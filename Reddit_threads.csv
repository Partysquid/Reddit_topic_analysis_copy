"""Please nerf irelia""..."
Me when I play Irelia
had two good plays last game :D
Golden Butt Irelia Chroma Skin Spotlight
One of many reasons why i love to play Irelia
"If you ever get stuck in between 2 enemies, you can buffer your ult backwards to hit both of them."
"I feel like i played this bad , but i will let you decide that :D"
Irelia Bot viable?
I'm a D3 Irelia main and I made a phone wallpaper with Irelia! Hope that you like it :)
Irelia Passive Rework Idea
clean irelia 1v2
Ignore the ult...
"Which items you can suggest to me for irelia againts the chars like garen, darius, teemo etc."
Defiant dance no longer grants stacks of Ionian Fervor
That's what happens when you don't ban Irelia | It's my first penta with her!
Question on upcoming nerfs
Irelia 4man stun
"With the W CD nerf, would essence reaver be a good buy now?"
Nothing really eye-popping about this play but I thought it was pretty cool-looking
Irelia indirectly nerfed
Preseason Secondary Runes
New Overgrowth on Irelia. Thought?
Irelia Mini ReWork Suggestion
"Is there any guides or something, that explains how to play Irelia ""in theory"" and not outdated runes or builds?"
