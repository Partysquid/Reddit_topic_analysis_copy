0,World Finals Shop ?,1,d5qdzj,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/d5qdzj/world_finals_shop/,0,1568797998.0,"Hi, I've never been to a LoL match of my life but this is gonna change for those Worlds.

I was wondering if Riot was planning to open a shop or something in the venue of the Finals.

Because I heard many people saying that even with the world in Korea or China they weren't many things to buy, especially team merch.

The Worlds of League of Legend is THE evenement who gather teams across all the globe to fight before the most amazing crowds. And I think it's fair to say that a lot of fans would be delighted to be able to buy merchandasing from their favorites team because they can't buy it the rest of the year.

As a french (maybe you guess it from my english) it's very difficult to find jersey, jacket or anything LoL team related in shop here and I thinks it the perfect occasion.

There’s literally no point to playing ranked. When I first started playing the game a few months ago, I was getting 30 lp per game and climbed from bronze 4 to silver 1. A couple months later i’m hardstuck silver 1. My MMR is apparently shit even though I hard carry 4/5 games and usually end up with top damage and kills as jungled. I get about 17 lp a game and lose the same amount even when I que with my gold friends. The game doesn’t give a fuck about if you’ve improved or not your MMR remains the same through all eternity. I have higher elo friends who constantly tell me how much they can’t believe i’m silver and not higher but it doesn’t matter. Even if I hard carry 4 games in a row and make promo i’ll lose 6 straight. 4 because one or two people int too hard and 2 because I have an good game but not good enough to hard carry. What’s really annoying is how the game is set up. I get 17 lp per win and need 100lp plus 3 promo wins to move on. So i need to miraculously win about 6 games straight and then win 3 out 5 after. But match making isn’t consistent and will put you with trash people every other game. This isn’t a rant. It’s the reality of how bad competitive is. The only way to climb is doing what my friend did. Forget your main account where you have all your skins and champions and make a new one. He was hardstuck like me but ended up Gold 3 30 games into rank.

I don't think autofill is such an awful feature in the first place, but it has some serious issues. I first of all don't think there should be multiple autofilled players in one team, as that's just unfair, but that's not my biggest issue. 

The problem is when multiple people are autofilled _to each others roles_. Let me explain what I mean by that.

I queue mid/top. My duo was queueing jungle/mid. One game, I got autofilled to support, and he autofilled to top. Both of us getting autofilled is one thing, but why is he autofilled to _top_, one of the roles I queue for? Another game I got autofilled to jungle (against queueing mid/top), and our top asks for jungle since he is autofilled. 

Is this just anecdotal? This can't only have happened to me. It's really awful. Autofill in the first place is just bad mood, Riot, but this stuff is just silly.",2019-09-18 04:27:56

I didn't think they would roll it out that fast. Overall it'll take time to grow on me, I'm just not used to it. I don't blame Riot for doing this though. It seems like every major company has introduced a new minimalist/simple logo in the past decade. I stared at the old logo for a good while and yeah, while I love it, it kinda does looks old and outdated. I'll miss the old logo dearly...It just doesn't feel exactly right.

12,The Types of Supports You Meet in Solo Queue,3,d5pg2w,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/d5pg2w/the_types_of_supports_you_meet_in_solo_queue/,2,1568793327.0,"In this post I will attempt to provide a short description of the types of supports you will meet as a Solo ADC main in your journey through ranked Solo Queue. At the end of each section I will include a link that I think actually describes how you as an ADC main are feeling while playing with each type of Support.

**Engage Supports:**

The God:

This is the support that every ADC main dreams of getting. This player knows when to hold their abilities to create max lane pressure and when to use them to blow enemy summoners or set up a kill. Also likely seen to be playing around lane brush vision creating uncertainty for the enemy bot lane, and using timely roams mid to combine with the Jungler to get other lanes ahead. This is a game where you as the ADC likely go 20/1, and if you are in low elo some of your team may even honor you for carrying, while in your head you know all you really did was ride in the baby carrier on your Support’s back as they got you big and strong.

[How you feel as ADC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyO1dRCNnTY&t=0m25s)

The “Leeroy Jenkins”:

The difference between this player and The God is that there is no one acting as the captain of this players brain ship. Likely to be found running through a triple stacked minion wave crashing at your tower to flash engage on the enemy Braum while you have summoner disadvantage. Other possible plays include initiating an all-in after you have spam pinged the enemy Jungler crossing over crab and two pinks while your Jungler is invading enemy top side jungle or initiating a dive on a full health enemy with heal when they themselves do not have ignite up.

[How you feel as ADC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLyOj_QD4a4&t=1m24s)

The Autofill:

This player is playing Pyke or Thresh nearly 100% of the time and does not have mastery 4 unlocked if you check in the loading screen. There are two subcategories for this type of player. Type 1: This player uses their abilities off cooldown usually missing them so badly that the enemy ADC would have to dash + flash into them to get hit, bonus points if they run 5 miles past the wave to do this so they are an easy kill after they have lost their spell threats. Type 2: This player is usually playing behind you, but in vision so the enemy knows exactly where they are at all times. Will be full mana and full health for 90% of laning phase making sure to conserve those resources for late game.

How you feel as ADC: [Type 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKhOP1qk27c&t=0m41s) and [Thinking about Type 2's abilities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCadcBR95oU)

**Enchanter Supports:**

The Savior:

This player will make sure you are safe at all times. Likely to be seen using all abilities to their max effectiveness to peel and buff you as the ADC, including the 3 active items they have in their inventory. This player has immaculate vision control, so your team will always have superior information leading up to a fight, and if you follow their calls the game is 100% won. An example play in a teamfight might be exhausting the assassin immediately out of stealth then using their first cc to allow you to create distance then predicting the enemy flash with their secondary cc.

[How you feel as ADC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZjt_sA2eso&t=1m3s)

The Stereotype:

This player is unlikely to be seen by you as the ADC because they are playing so far back it will be impossible to have both them and the minions you are trying to last hit on the same screen. They are probably watching Netflix, doing homework, or playing another game in the background during laning phase and typing things like “just scale bro” in the chat when you ask them to walk up and help. At least in teamfights they will find a way hit around half of their buttons on you at a suboptimal time before you explode as an underfed ADC and all your team spam pings you and types “gg no dmg adc”.

[How you feel as ADC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQHsXMglC9A&t=2m9s)

The Autofill:

In the best case scenario this player is a slightly worse Savior. They don’t have all the perfect active timings and cc layering down, but you can’t really expect that from an autofill. All in all this player is someone who you can work with to make the best of a bad situation to get a lead bot. Worst case scenario this player has effectiveness of The Stereotype and the positioning of an engage support allowing the enemy bot lane to feast off them making this lane tougher than if they had just AFKd.

[How you feel as ADC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkDDOs0EedM&t=1m17s)

**Mage Supports:**

The Real Carry:

This player will do more damage than you at all points of the game. Since their champion has less effective supporting abilities out lane you will likely have the least damage on the team in these types of games. End game damage graphs with this player look something like ADC: 17k, Brand: 55k. That being said at least they hit all their abilities in lane allowing you to take early tower because the enemy has to base or die every other wave. Because they are the real carry you will likely not be allowed to catch side waves or push mid after they complete their Support quest because let’s be honest the real carry needs that gold and solo xp, and that’s not gonna be you this game, but hey at least you won the game right?

[How you feel as ADC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csu4WqqBD9s&t=0m9s)

The “Real Carry”:

This type of player is basically the same as The Real Carry with the following differences: 1: The “Real Carry” is much more likely to take Barrier, TP, Cleanse, or Ghost as a secondary summoner making sure to offer as little as possible to help in the 2v2 for laning. 2: The “Real Carry” is much more likely to start Doran’s Ring + 2 pots or Dark Seal + Refillable, since they will be racking up the kills and getting money that way along with splitting farm from the start “accidentally”. 3: The “Real Carry” misses about 95% of their skillshots throwing them out at awkward timings/angles making them as easy as possible to dodge. Likely end game damage graphs look something like ADC: 7k, Xerath: 16k, but hey at least you learned something you can apply next game right?

[How you feel as ADC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYS0EeaAUMw)

**Off-Meta Supports:**

The Autofilled One-trick:

When this type of player is autofilled as support, they decide the best chance of winning is not by first timing a support champion in ranked, but rather by playing their one trick with you in bot lane. These types of players usually bring some kind of CC with their champion and if you can pull off an early play against an enemy who likely doesn’t know the matchup well it can snowball extremely quickly. The drawback is that these players champions were not designed for the support role and will quickly get outscaled be traditional supports if you can’t create a decisive early advantage.

[How you feel as ADC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZ1Rb9hC4JY&t=0m47s)

The Psychopath:

This player is usually seen playing Shaco or Teemo. If things go well in lane by their standards, things can be fine. Their traps and blind in Teemo’s case can be extremely annoying for the enemy botlaners. These players have all the best cheeses after hundreds or more likely thousands of games perfecting their craft. However, if one thing goes wrong this player is likely to give up on lane completely and go to another lane and take xp from a solo laner, while you get completely zoned as the AD by Leona and Ezreal spams laugh while calmly freezing the wave under tower. Another possible response by this type of player in the case of a perceived mistake by the AD, is to chose one quadrant of the Jungle to go AFK in and make a trap dungeon. Tread carefully with this type of player fellow AD mains.

[How you feel as ADC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdKqAVpUOwI&t=0m5s)

The Actual Troll:

This player is not happy with the fact they got Autofilled as support. They will likely type things in chat during champ select such as “mid or feed” or “dodge or lose”. If it is not your series it as best for your sanity as the ADC to dodge, since your solos and Jungler do not care as much about your suffering as you do. However, if it is your series and you decide the 6.66% of winning is worth it you will likely see some or all of the following: Champions: Nunu or Singed or Rammus, Summoner Spells: Ghost + Cleanse or Ghost + TP, Keystone: Predator, executing to turret, executing to neutral monsters, running into the enemy team and dying, mobi boots, other items with movement speed actives/passives, typing obscenities/slurs in all chat, all ended by actually AFKing.

[How you feel as ADC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNxjIbH-Grs&t=0m5s)

**Conclusion:**

This is obviously intentionally hyperbolic for comedic effect, and I'm not trying to say that Solo Support mains don't go through similar struggles with their ADCs. If you feel like I missed out on a Support archetype feel free to let me know, or if you feel like I didn't properly capture the essence of how you feel laning with a certain Support archetype add a link that better describes how you think it feels.",2019-09-18 03:55:27

14,Skins as extensions of Character Lore; Blood Moon Aatrox.,4,d5p2zt,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/d5p2zt/skins_as_extensions_of_character_lore_blood_moon/,1,1568791614.0,"With the recent chat about the visual storytelling within eastern-influenced Swords skin-line, I started thinking about how skins may or may not reflect aspects of a character that might not be clear in their base skin - either due to a mask (specifically, Master Yi's face reveal as Eternal Sword Yi) or Spooky Gangplank representing a period of demise.  There is a consistency to each character (outside of E-sports skins, i. e. Rakan): Jax always has 3 fingers on a hand (even Godfist!), Miss Fortune's recent art update had her near universally redheaded (I think Cowgirl Miss Fortune is blonde), Braum is always bulky with a prominent mustache, and so on.  Each champion skin is essentially a re-telling, often parallel to their role in the main canon - whatever it may be.  

So with that premise in mind, I started thinking about Aatrox.  Prior to his rework, Aatrox's skins were all monstrous and depicted an angular (inverted triangular) shaped head: His horns had a distinct Devilman-ish shape like a V, the Justicar skin had angular wings to promote the same shape, pirate-themed skin was a hammerhead shark.  All of these forms were consistent.  Then, following his rework/Boriscension(?) and the first skin to be released post-rework is Blood Moon Aatrox.  This is the first Aatrox skin with a distinctly human features.  I'm not very well versed on the Blood Moon skinline, and I'm wondering: is there a link between the champion that would become Aatrox in Shurima and the human features that are present in Blood Moon Aatrox?",2019-09-18 03:26:54

Not just for pro play, Riot gets data for every game played, they could make bots capable of playing in every tier and people could test their skill against them if they so wished. Currently, the bots available sure can be great for newbies to learn the game but they shortly become irrelevant once people reach high levels. It would be great to play a bot game against bots with a standardized skill level. On the high end, what if new strategies could be developed off training iron bots up to challenger lets say similarly to how OpenAI trained their from master up. New comps and roles for champions could spring out. Never imagined strategies could impact the game in ways we never thought of.

As we saw with OpenAI, high tier players learned lots of strategies from their own bots. Content creators made it their chalenge to beat these bots and they improved along the way. We already know AI improvements can push skill caps to superhuman levels and multiple examples in other games can prove this. Why is Riot not pushing for a BOT improvement of any sort? Or at least none in the past who knows how long?",2019-09-18 03:07:26

31,My take on Leauges ballancing,0,d5obvt,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/d5obvt/my_take_on_leauges_ballancing/,8,1568788096.0,"Before you read, i know this is a lot of text, but this has been building up inside of my head for a while now and i had to let it out.

This is more to players that are heavily invested in league

Iam a D2 Darius OTP and quit playing ranked about 2 months ago. I only play Decay games from now on.

I have been playing leauge for over 5 years now, and its getting less funn every patch.  

Its not that i dont want to play leauge, its just that i cannot enjoy it as i used to.

This could be me changing, but i also think its riot ballancing the game in a way that is not funn for most players.

I have a lot of good menories in league and it hurts not being able to enjoy it anymore.

I didnt use any statistiks for this.

This is mostly subjective.

This is a Darius perspective on the game.

Feel free to add your point of view in the comments.

\*\*Counterpicks:\*\*

Yes counterpicks are important and should always exist. But at this point it has gone a little to far i think. Counterpick Meta is not funn. No one wants to loose game in champ select, or already be at a huge disadvantage, when the game hasnt even started yet.

I get it, for proplay, its way more interesting to watch and there drafting is a huge part of the game.  

But for soloq i dont see the funn in it. When the enemy Toplaner locks in something like Kennen  or Jayce, you are already way less likely to carry the game, due to how save the enemy laner can play. And if they basicly neutralize you in champ select, they chance of winning a coinflip is already higher, than if they played a proper meele champion.

I am not saying, that there is nothing you can do about Ranged toplaners, but if you ask me the amout of work you have to put into beating them, is unreasonably high, when comparing to meele toplaners.

For Example, Riven is good against Darius, but if you are good on Darius, you can beat a Riven, and same aplys for the Riven.

If either Darius or riven makes a small misplay, the other one can capitalize on that, and snowball the lane.

But when facing ranged toplaners, the amount of misplays they have to make in order to die, is a lot higher.

\_The better Player should winn. Counterpicks should only so much compensate for a skillgap. I think for now they are too effective.\_

Note on Ranged Toplaners:

For some reason most ranged toplaner have an escape tool. So even if they make a mistake, they have a tool to make up for that mistake.  

Some spells are on a reasonable Cooldown, like Gnar E cooldown is 22 at rank 1, but some champs like Kennen  or Karma, have it on a realy low CD (10,12 sec CD), wich sets it on a way lower cooldown than most engage spells from mele champs, wich tent to be on 18+ sec CD.

Note on Klepto:

Main problem is Kleptomancy on Ranged champs. Their Poke can already be hard to deal with at times, and they are likely to get a CS lead early on and them getting rewarded even more by Klepto, makes it kinda unfair.

Note on Ranged champs and Keystones:

Some Runes have their Variation depending if they are taken by Meele oder Ranged champs. (Fleet, Conq, Graps, Glacial)

But somehow other Runes dont have that difference. Klepto on Ranged is the same as on Meles, when Rangeds can use it way more effectively.

Phase rush is the same story. A Ranged Champs can always make more use if a move. On top of that, they can obviusly activate it from range, giving them an even bigger advantage.  

Aftershock has also been a problem on ranged champs in the past. I dont know why riot just disables it for ranged champs, that would have saved us from a lot of trouble.

There is a good reason why Ranged champs have lower base  movementspeed values.

I am not calling for these Runes to get nerfed into oblivion, but for them to be more effective on Meele Champs.

\*\*Ballance of scaling champions:\*\*

I dont think champs that scale realy good into mid and lategame should be allowed to also have a realy strong early game.

Usually champtions are either strong early, mid or lategame and are not strong in all 3 phases of the game.

Olaf is a good example for this. His early game is realy opressive, and if he gets ahead in lane its torture. But the further it goes into the game, the faster he falls of duo to his low range and bad engage. Very strong Early.

But then there are some other champions, like Riven, Jax and Fiora. All three of them are very Potent early game, and can beat out any mele toplaner if played right. They Have a Strong early game, and will scale better than any other Toplaner.

I dont think it maks any sense from a gameplay view, to have champs that scale like this: strong Early --> stronger mid --> even stronger lategame.

It is NOT funn to play against, knowing that one death will end the lane for you, but when they die, they can always rely on good scaling.

Good Examples for scaling:  

Aatrox, Urgot, Kayle, Darius, Gp, Morde, Yorik

Bad Examples for scaling:

Akali, Riven, Trynda, Fiora, Jax

\*\*Mage Items and MR:\*\*

I think mage items ovver too much utility and are too effective.  

Mage items vs Bruiser Items:

Protobelt 300 HP, Morellos 300 HP, Liandrys 300 HP, Rylais 300HP.

Trinity 250 HP, Black Cleaver 400 HP, Steraks 450 HP

Just as in movementspeed values, there again is a good reason why ranged champs have lower base hp than meele champions.  

I will not explain why, because i think it should be fairly obvious to anyone who is playing the game at a decent level.

Then why do Mage items, that any mage can buy in a dmg oriented build, give more, or just a little less HP than Bruiser items. And while Trinity and Black Cleaver do not stack well together, the Mages items stack very well together, and it is not rare to see 2 or more on the same champion.

A Mage with 600-900 bonus HP is a lot more effecive than a Bruiser with 600-850 bonus HP.

This just gets worse due to the existence of the single best item in the game. Zhonias

I think it has the Single best Active in the Game, because i have seen it change the outcome of so many games by itself.

It also gives armor, wich scales very well with the tons of bonus HP mages are getting.

CDR is also a big Problem. You can get 40% cdr with just one or two items.  

(Protobelt +Zhonias +20% from runes, or Ludens +20% from runes)

There are a lot of Mage items that have CDR now. A lot more than it used to be. Having 40% CDR used to be a Luxury, that you had to take some downsides for, but nowadays its hard to have less than 30%

three more mage items are a huge problem.

Protobelt is way too cheap. Compared to bruiser items its way too effecitve. The cheapest powerspike you can get as a bruiser is Black cleaver for 3000 Gold, protobelt is 500 gold less, but still they can oneshot you with it. The power spike is just as good, for a much lower price.

Combining it with Zhonias makes it even more ridiculus, because the HP and armor scale very well together.

Morellos it is just too good. For some reason it has 2 very good passives combined in just one item.  

Magic pen has always been core on a lot of mages. But since the Item rework they also get Healing reduction for free

Void staff gives too much penetraion. Combine that with how much flat penetration exists, and tanks start to look realy squishy.

Note on MR items:

Spirit Vissage is the only viable option most of the time.  

Adaptive Helm for some reason has 100 HP less than Spirit Vissage, making in bad in comparison

Abyssal Mask Only good on tanky Champs that deal magic dmg.

Maw Basicly dead, because it doesnt stack with steraks.

There are not enough MR items and the options we have are not great.

Adaptive Helm and Spirit Vissage have terrible build paths. Spectres is a terrible item and doesnt do anything for you in lane or mid/lanetgame.

Also these two items have Base reg as a stat, wich doesnt realy make sense. It doesnt make you more tanky, and having more base regen, when your HP pool is like 3k+ is irellevant.  

If you compare that with the wide range of armor items, it becomes obvious that something has to be done.

Note on healing reduction:

the amount of healing reduction there is forced riot to buff all champs that rely on healing, to still make them somewhen usefull, even if healing reduction is being build.  

That again forces you to get healing reduction every time a healing champ is picked, because if you dont they will be too strong.

It is not funn to have to buy a 800 gold item (Executioners), just to not auto loose to healing champs, nor is it funn to loose, just because your enemy bough an 800 Gold item.

Note on raptors cloak:

Shame it doesnt build into any good items

\*\*Teamplay:\*\*

I get it, its a team based game, and its more funn in competetive to watch a well coordinated team.

But For soloq, the more team oriented gameplay is not funn at all. Solo Carries are rare these days and require way more efford than a few seasons ago.

It doesnt feel like the best player decides the game, but the worst player does.

If one of your teammates doesnt want to winn, the chances are, you wont winn.

Is a game of ""who gets the r%%%%%""

Yetardu obv. will climb over time if you play good, but as someone who doesnt want to waste hundreds of hours into league just to get a decent rank, this feels very unrewarding. If iam playing good i want to climb, and not play 300 games to winn 170 of them and climb through that.

\*\*Powercreep:\*\*

There is too much dmg in the game. Runes giving a lot of damage, wile the defensive ones are a lot weaker than the dmg ones.

It is a oneshot, or get oneshot, wich i dont think is enjoyable.

Note on new releases and reworks:

This falls also under powercreep. Riot has the tendency to make every new champ and rework ""better"" than the previous, aka overloading the kit to absurd levels, best examples being Akali, Kaisa and Irelia. Even after countless nerfs these champs are still top tier, wich i think says enough for itself.

They dont seem to care if somethng is funn to play against or not.  

This leaves older champs

\*\*Tank ballancing:\*\*

Stop giving tanks more damage. If you want to buff them make them tanky. Tanks, its in the name.

\*\*Skinns affecting game ballance:\*\*

It probably has always been like this, but i feel like lately riot has gotten too greedy.

Kaisa is one of the strongest champs in the game and has been like this pretty much since her release.

But since she has a prestige skin and 4 other skinns, she clearly is getting favored by Riot.

Kha  was already in a good spot before the buff they gave him. They clearly buffed him to sell the tons of championship chromas they released last year.

Eve was in no need of a buff, but strangely also has a prestige skin.

Riven is getting buffs on pbe the same time a prestige skin is getting added.

\*\*Closing words:\*\*

i will stick to league at least untill next preseason.

I dont want to drop league, but if it gets worse as it did the seasons before, im afrain there is no other way to me.

A lot of my friends in Dia+ recently quit league for similar reasons.",2019-09-18 02:28:16

If the bot lane waves aren’t pushed up when your jungler spam pings for help, you’re probably not going to be able to come help. You’ll miss cs, you’re gonna take damage from tanking the minions and the enemy lane is going to get there faster which allows them to have control over the river.

I’m a D3 ADC main, and each time I don’t have prio and I couldn’t help my jungler to get the scuttle crab, I get flamed. That’s an instant mute on him!

50,Flash should be removed?,0,d5nkek,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/d5nkek/flash_should_be_removed/,21,1568784660.0,"So my friends and I have been talking about it for a while, and I firmly believe that flash should be removed or at least heavily changed to something more like Hextech Flashtraption. Here is why:

If you play the game at all, you've definitely heard of the summoner spell, Flash, and in fact you probably take it every game. Not only do you take this summoner spell *every single time* you play League of Legends, but I would be willing to bet that you use it at least 3 times per game. With this in mind, I feel like taking this spell away from the player or heavily changing it to a channeled ability would bring a lot of fun and innovation to the game. The entire pacing of the game would change, and the viability of champions would come into question.

The spell is so impactful that multiple champions have had their usage of it nerfed slightly. The 3 that come to mind are Galio (no more Flash+W), Tahm Kench (I believe he's now grounded during his Devour-W), and Rakan (Making Rakan wait .5 seconds after his ult to use his W or flash).

Now imagine if the spell was only able to be used through a channel, or possibly only while you're out of combat with enemy champions.

&#x200B;

Flash can be a very frustrating spell to play against in many situations as the use of it removes a lot of outplay potential. Let's say you dash over a wall to escape the dreaded 5-stack Darius, and in this world he is not able to follow you over without navigating around the wall in his own way or hooking you back across. Dashes on many champions would have to be nerfed to follow up this change, but I still think it would be interesting.

Let me know what you think or if you've had any similar discussions with other players.

EDIT:  Let me present this as an idea:

Replace Flash with another blink that requires you to set a marker at a nearby destination by channeling that you can blink back to with the press of a button. It would act just like Flash, but it requires forethought. You could still play immobile champions into assassins, but it would feel less cheesy most of the time.",2019-09-18 01:31:00

Sometimes i will be near the turret and the plating gets destroyed by minions, and because i didn't attack the turret recently i don't receive gold from it. So how many seconds ago do i have to have attacked the turret to still get gold?

And my second question, what is the range of giving gold? Like if for example i pushed the minions up and attack the turret once, and i go back to my turret (in midlane) and then the minions destroy the plating, is that close enough?

I am here to break the components of balancing and etc. Btw i'm low elo so don't trust on my words and feel free to counterargument anything I say.

1.) Competitive VS Solo/Duos

In the upcoming patch note 9.19, riot seem to aim towards competitive since it is the worlds' patch. But this heavily impacts the solo/duo in a negative way. And because of one champion being buffed, it doesn't guarantee that it will be picked in worlds.

2.) What they see vs What they don't see

Most balance changes are aimed towards champions that are mostly played. Ex: Akali, Aatrox, Jax, and etc. But what about the ones not being picked like Maokai. Focusing on what's up there will cause more disruption. Are they really op or is it because their counters aren't doing so well rn.

3.) Placebo buffs and nerfs

We get these buffs and nerfs, but are they really what they entail? Like with lissandra, buffing the cd on her e. Is that what really is causing her to not be picked? 

4.) Risk of buffing a champion

Certain champions are too scary to buff cuz of their kit. Prime example is Kalista. she was either broken or useless like she is now. this goes onto the next issue-

5.) unable to balance

I see that with champs that riot balance team seems to have difficult balancing. They use the rework card. Remember old irelia? she had insane kit. old galio? his kit was weird.",2019-09-18 01:11:10
60,The Design philosophy that keeps ruining Leauge (in my opinion),0,d5na3a,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/d5na3a/the_design_philosophy_that_keeps_ruining_leauge/,4,1568783385.0,"Somehow what used to be the love of my gaming life isn't fun to play. I love League of Legends but hate playing it.

I just want to disscus some design choices the devs made over the years. There's one thing in particular that I've been thinking about.

To illustrate it, think about any sports game.  The rules are always very straight forward and simple. Like Tabletennis: Two players with a bat, a net between them, a ball. And they hit that ball with their bats. It's that simple.

But somehow it can get extremly advanced and strategic. I bet all professioal players could talk for hours about different strategies. Whether you start off offensive or stay back, different ways to hit the ball etc.

But the rules of the game, the outer context remains very very simplistic. This applies to any sport.

Complexity comes from simplicity. There's an outer context (rules) given, and you use your creativity to make the most out of it.

Just watch this Video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpllAjxOIUU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpllAjxOIUU)

It's amazing how so few rules create such a great game.

And the same was true for League of Legends. \*Complexity came from playstyle, not from the games rules\*

If you look at the kits of older champions you'll notice they are quite simple kit wise. They had abilies like :

Q : Stun an enemy

What sounds way to simple at fist was quite complicated in reality. Because there are 5 players up against each other who all have a mind of their own. \*The complexity of the game was largely in the mind of the players, not the outer context.\*

But now, the devs keep adding tons and tons of additional rules:

\- The runes. that are strong enough to be the abilty of a champion

\- Item actives, like hextech protobelt. In Season I to III this active effect alone could have been considered as a champions    ability, but not as an item

\- The same is true for the jungle plants. The red one is almost like a flash, the blue ones like an Ashe Hawkshot

\- Scuttler

\- Overloaded champions kits like Zoe or Yasuo

\*This is where the Design philosophy changed\*

Instead of giving players a simplistic sandbox to tinker around with, they deliever a mess.

Adding all of this stuff limits the flow of the game.

In the past, you had a small selection of spells and had to come up with creative ways to use them as best as possible.

\*\*The limitations define the game\*\*

But now you got literally everything on your hand. Dashes, stuns, heals and what to I know.

Imagine two people competing in parcour. One of them is a normal human, the other one mutated and can fly. The first one is doing all of those cool wallruns, jumps and balances on scaffoldings. The second guy just floats along. He doesen't have to put any efford or creativity in it. He just continuously floats.

Yes, he is ""stronger"" and won the race, but did he have fun ? No. It was boring, because there weren't any obstacles.

And Riot is now making sure every player is able to fly.

That activily disencourages teamplay. Because of your limitations, you had to play together. You may had some great offenstive spells, but not a lot of CC. Nowadays everyone has everything.

It kills the game.

I hope you get what I mean.",2019-09-18 01:09:45

There often gets to be a point in mid-to-late game when both teams are in the middle of the map preparing to team fight. Both sides are evenly matched and everyone is nervously running around in circles like idiots trying to poke with cheap shots, trying to feel each other out.

I am the tank so must be present for this. There comes to be a moment when we've all been doing the nervous goober-dance for so long that I get a sinking feeling like we're all gonna die. You have to realize, if both teams have been doing this truffle shuffle for a solid minute the same thing is probably going through everyones' mind: ""we have a 50% chance to win this fight...  : /  ""

Idk if it's because I'm at low ELO that this scenario keeps happening but this is what irks me about it. To my mind that's not good odds. In many games you will lose the whole match off this coin toss of anti-strategy. Why do so many players behave in this irrational way engaging in big clusterfuck fights where the odds are, ""hell idk, maybe we beat them... maybe not, let's do it!"" 

At some point there's got to be a player that runs off to split-push. That's what I finally realized and the reason why I'm playing tank less. As the tank, when I get that sinking feeling that we're about to engage in a collective-suicide it doesn't matter what my intuition says-- I have no choice. The high-damage characters are gonna drag me into this ignorant fight and I want to protect them.

Screw that. I'm gonna split-push next time. No more being yalls punching bag. When my intuition tells me not to engage I'm saying C'YA LATER! and pushing top lane with Udyr or Trynd.",2019-09-17 23:53:23

Right. 

But what about the trolls, the jungler comes gank your lane, takes the kill and still farms until the enemy tower, your adc is dead btw, why this kind of player isn't punished? Just because he is ""playing bad"", some may say it's lack of  etiquette some may think this won't bother or hurt the adc, but this attitude doesn't make you tilt? So why an attitude like that isn't punished? Just because he didn't type anything? So why is there a chat, for the ADC to rage about the inconvenience and be punished?

THIS ABOVE IS WHY I WILL NEVER PLAY LEAGUE OF LEGENDS ANYMORE, I'M A MAIN SUPPORT, DIDNT PLAY FOR SIX MONTHS TO COME TO THAT.

The second thing is, bear with me, you have to have a really big brain to think of that, I watch streamers staying too much time trying to find a match, ok, but he is a streamer he plays professionally his MMR is god like, and there isn't that much players with that characteristic and if he is a professional, he probably knows how to play any lane or at least knows the tatics, SO what about two kind of matchmaking for those WHO like me doesn't bother to stay ten minutes waiting for a quality match, to find players that will take only the lanes that they asked for? IS THAT SO HARD TO THINK OF?

From a FORMER player who finds itself trully disrespected by RIOT, going to ask my brother to stop playing and other players that I found nice to play these two last weeks, because playing solo ranked is kind a self harm, expose that they are also been disrespect.

95,[Long post] Karma changes on PBE are an undeserved archetype kill and this is not getting the discussion it should - reasons why this is wrong,140,d5lnzr,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/d5lnzr/long_post_karma_changes_on_pbe_are_an_undeserved/,54,1568776341.0,"**FACT:** Karma is currently a staple pick in competitive play. For variety’s sake in anticipation of World’s, it’s completely reasonable to nerf Karma alongside several picks who share that staple status, as seen on PBE.

I wanted to preface this post with that statement because it’s easy to fall into the discussion of should x champion be nerfed and devolve into a battle of bias accusations. This isn't about that.

I don’t think Riot is wrong for wanting to nerf Karma, even if the situation in which Karma is finding her third nerf this year is infuriating, with pro play arbitrarily deciding the champion they valued a fringe pick before 9.12 rising to 100% P/B status in the span of one patch of buffs, the most egregious of which was reverted within a single patch, only to remain uncomfortably high in presence and consequently nerfed again in 9.15 to a state almost **objectively worse than before 9.12**.

That said, the above is not the only fact relevant to this matter:

**FACT:** Karma does not fall into any of the categories Riot outlined as flags for champion nerfs.

You can read them [here.](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2019/05/dev-champion-balance-framework/) Pro play considers champions with 80% presence in major leagues for two consecutive patches to be nerf-worthy (or 90+% in a single patch) and Karma's has been [hovering 55% for two patches.](https://gol.gg/champion/champion-stats/38/season-S9/split-Summer/tournament-ALL/patch-9.16/role-ALL/league-ALL/) Moreover...

**FACT:** Karma’s presence in pro play continues to fall from patch to patch.

[Look at this graph](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIlNIVXpIns) of how [Karma's pickrate in pro play has evolved since 9.12.](https://imgur.com/a/rdrXaft)

Karma's pickrate trends down as nerfs come and pro play's incredibly inflexible concept of meta budges. Is this a guarantee that Karma won't be seen in more than half of games at Worlds? No. But if your goal is to further dissuade a downward trending champion pick to provide better entertainment for your tournament, your submission of changes shouldn't be a sledgehammer of a nerf that effectively kills an archetype by targeting its only freely-usable damaging ability. For reference, AP Karma makes for **88% of its current picks in competitive**.

Which brings me to my main point: *the prelimary change Karma received on PBE is an archetype killing nerf that is not at all proportional to Karma’s offenses as an overrepresented champion in pro play.* To answer why the changes are unfair to Karma and its players, we have to address the age old question:

#What was Karma actually designed to do?

A question with a simple answer that is incredibly hard to get across. On one hand you have the people who believe “Karma is a support being played in lanes she doesn’t belong in” (which I suspect might include Rioters responsible for this change). On the other, you have the cult of old Karma (which by the way existed for a third of the time “new” Karma has) who brigade every single official Riot communication avenue there is to talk about the injustice of losing two fans and two badly designed mechanics, and love to pretend the answer doesn’t exist. 

But guess what, her designers provided in-depth rationale in 2013 unlike anything we get nowadays: 

[“Originally envisioned as a support, Karma’s fringe successes actually came from players using her in the top or mid lanes as an AP burst mage with support abilities, much like Zilean or Morgana. We like this direction and want to encourage you to boost both her offensive and support abilities by building AP. We also want to make sure she can hold her own as a solo or with a lane partner.](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=3197509&page=279#post35623691)

[Finally, we’ve updated her skills so allies are reliant on Karma, but Karma’s not reliant on them. She’s got enough power at her fingertips to feel strong as a mage or as a support without teammates having to work in perfect concert for you to be effective.”](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=3197509&page=279#post35623691)

Let me highlight that for you:

#""[We] want to encourage you to boost both her offensive and support abilities by building AP.""

#""We want to make sure she can hold her own as a solo or with a lane partner [...] as a mage or as a support.""

**[All versions of Karma build AP.](https://imgur.com/a/1UkOPsC)** As she was designed to do. As were literally encouraged by her designers to do. This nerf on PBE isn't targeting one specific subset of Karma, it's an attempt to shoehorn her into one role despite the explicit intention of her designers, despite there being no justification for a nerf of this caliber by any metric. In solo queue, Karma's a 50% winrate champion with ~10% pickrate and sub 2% banrate. Her players don't deserve the mistreatment of crippling her Q ratio to be lower than any other similar ability on a mage or a support.

**My suggestion to anyone who cares to hear:**

Attack the waveclear. Like Lissandra illustrated early this year, nerfing the early cooldown of a bread and butter ability is enough to remove the champion from pro play where waveclear is king. Karma's already statistically one of the worst laners in competitive with negative average stats for gold, cs and experience @10 and 15. You can literally add 3 or 4 seconds to her rank 1 Q, scaling down to live values at rank 5, and watch her disappear. This would still be a brutal nerf, as it was for Lissandra. Let the rest of us mortal players who make up for 99.9% of the playerbase have an endgame fantasy to strive for instead of nuking her primary way of scaling in any role because of the whims of pro play.

***

**TL;DR |** Karma’s PBE nerfs don’t answer to Riot official criteria for nerfs. They’re way too drastic for what Karma does to pro play drafts and they’re a clear attempt to cripple an archetype Karma was explicitly designed to fulfill. “We want to encourage you to boost both her offensive and support abilities by building AP […] as a mage or as a support.”",2019-09-17 23:12:21

100,The counterplay to Illaoi's E is very minimal since the ability effectively has no downtime at rank 1 should she hit it - proposing cooldown nerfs,0,d5lk5x,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/d5lk5x/the_counterplay_to_illaois_e_is_very_minimal/,9,1568775873.0,"I won't lie I struggle playing into Illaoi a huge amount, she seems to have low mana costs, high waveclear and still be a total beefcake at the same time. You have some time in the early game where you can beat her out in trades if you play them right but I find that window closes very quickly and soon you are just totally unable to trade with her.

A large part of this seems to be because her E offers extremely little counterplay other than to dodge it. When Riot released her they made a point of saying that the way to stop her getting this free damage on you is to fight her since it lowers the amount of time the Spirit is there. This absolutely does not work, if you're hit by an Illaoi E you just have to run due to damage stacking on you from both the spirit and onto your directly. It is such an unhealthy lane interaction to literally be forced to run away (and it's not like its a short range) while still taking up to half your HP in damage just because she hit one ability.

As much as I'm laying into the damage and counterplay of the ability I personally find the larger problem and the main point of this post to be it's cooldown:

A huge part of how oppressive this feels is that the E has only got a 16 second cooldown level 1 (no cooldown reduction) that starts on cast. If she hits you with one there is only a downtime of 9 seconds where she doesn't have it up and assuming you've not been able to chase her off it (which is likely for a previously stated reasons) you will be a vessel for 10 seconds making it extremely hard to punish her while it's down. There if effectively 0 downtime on this ability if she hits it in lane, it's simply too rewarding to go along with the damage it grants.

I propose some cooldown increases to her E's early levels and maybe having the cooldown start after the Spirit has died so it doesn't overlap with the vessel duration. Something along the lines of 20+ seconds rank 1 down to 15 at rank 5 would be a good start in my opinion just to allow opposing laners a solid amount of time to punish her while it's down.

What I'm proposing is cc'ing urgot should at least stop him from using his W for a few seconds so there's a window where he is open.

Are assasins required in any team composition, or are they there just to shut down the enemy win condition? Are juggernuts the win condition themself, or fit in other comps? Is not picking a full ad team a win condition?

(Rhetorical question),0,d5k90z,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/d5k90z/how_do_you_explain_to_someone_why_overstaying_is/,9,1568770272.0,"Playing on a low gold smurf I noticed overstay is so ubiquitous that it happens virtually every time there is an opportunity for it at all and a great many games where you were ahead are lost because teammates overstay until the enemy is ahead.

Telling someone to back and/or pinging them back obviously doesn't do anything because if it's not their own idea to back then they won't back, so that got me thinking; How do you explain to someone that overstaying is bad? The more I thought about it the more impossible it seemed however, because the number of necessary assumptions keeps multiplying until something that sounds simple becomes very complicated.

Let's take a scenario like this: The game is relatively even but your team has a significant lead. Teams group, a fight happens, ultis are used, 2 enemies die, 1 ally die, you push down mid, inhib is open, some poke war happens between the 4 of you and the 3 of them, your team pokes the inhib, inhib falls, the 3 enemies are half hp/low mana no ultis with 2 enemies respawning within seconds, you 4 are half hp/low mana no ultis. You back away and recall, your 3 allies stay and die.

Now, I could say something like this: It's bad to stay in mid there because we have no resources left, they have home base advantage, 2 of them are spawning with new items and full hp coming to kill us with homeguard and we are 4v5 here which means we lose the fight so it's better to take the objective win and retreat to replenish resources/wait for cooldowns and buy.

The problem is, when I think about this, my head explodes because I realize the only reason this makes sense to me, is because I already understand it. But someone who **does** overstay in that situation obviously does not understand it, so how do you explain it to **them**?

&#x200B;

Allow me to impersonate my image of an overstayer for a moment to play devil's advocate and I will try to explain what I mean.

""What do you mean we have no resources left? This isn't Starcraft xD we don't collect minerals or whatever resources here, go play minecraft if you want to collect resources lul.""

""Home base advantage, what the fuck is that? We are all on the same map here.""

""What do you mean 2 of them are spawning, they are dead they can't do anything.""

""What do you mean they are spawning with new items, how do you know they bought items?""

""Coming to kill us with homeguard? They are not even on your screen lul how can you know what they are doing xD""

""4v5? No all 5 of us are alive.""

""What do you mean our 5:th member isn't here be because he just respawned? That's not my fault he needs to group with us that noob.""

""You say we lose the fight because they have 2 at full HP/mana and 5 ppl to our 4? Oh so you can see the future now wow amazing go lottery but if you are going to have such a negative attitude in the game I'm going to have to mute and report you ok?""

""Retreat? Bro we are **winning** we just **destroyed their inhib** we are **winning as fuck** so if we **stay here** we are gonna be **more winning** how do you expect to win if you only run away xD""

""What do you mean 'replenish resources'? Again with 'resources' man? We are not playing Age Of Empires here bro there are no resources here this is League Of Legends are you asleep?""

My self imposed rules are, no duplicate champions, and no infinite scaling (no gathering storm, overgrowth, sion, nasus, etc.) 

The champions involved are, Kled, Sylas, Mordekaiser, Lee Sin, Janna, and a target dummy that we will assume has infinite HP but no armor whatsoever.

First of all, the attack damage of the hit.

Lee sin will have the following, 6 bloodthirsters, level 18, absolute focus, waterwalking, two adaptive force shards, and fully stacked eyeball collector,  giving him a total of **545** bonus AD, this is not nearly enough, in addition, there will be a Janna, who has a spellbinder, and 5 deathcaps, along with the same exact runes, with spellbinder active fully stacked, resulting in a janna with **1226** ability power,  so that her shield grants **162** bonus AD at max rank, adding this to lee sin we get **707** bonus AD

right now, a fully ranked lee sin ultimate will deal **2039**damage before mitigation, this is a lot, but the kick has an interesting property, where it essentially converts the kicked target into a projectile, dealing that same damage number, plus 18% of their bonus HP

in order to acquire the maximum bonus HP without any infinite stacking mechanics (again, no overgrowth, cho'gath, or sion) we need Mordekaiser's death realm, sylas to copy it, and the highest possible base hp target, which according to what I've found is level 18 kled, with 2950 base HP while on skarl. if we give kled the hp rune shard, 5 warmogs and a cinderhulk, he will have a total of **7998** health. If lee sin were to kick this kled at our hypothetical target it would deal **2947** physical damage. but it can go higher.

if sylas (again, with the same build as kled) steals mordekaisers ultimate and uses it to kill kled, he will gain 10% of kled's total HP, essentially an entire warmogs of value giving him a total HP of **8168** of course we also have mordekaiser, who will ult and kill sylas while sylas has the stolen stats. he will have **5986** bonus health, which added to lee sins kick results in **3116**

EDIT: I forgot to add a yuumi to lee sin, with Yuumi (having the same max AP build as janna) contributing **418** damage to Lee sin, bringing his super kick up to **3534** damage!

EDIT2: by adding Lulu ultimate (max ap build, again) to the mordekaiser being kicked, Morde gains another **1395** bonus hp, increasing the total kick damage to **3785**!

If anyone has any ideas how to add to this without infinite scaling I will edit them into the post!",2019-09-17 20:50:00

134,"If Veigar and Lissandra got new passives because mana sustain passives are bad, Xerath should get a new passive too",368,d5jooc,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/d5jooc/if_veigar_and_lissandra_got_new_passives_because/,185,1568767776.0,"I remember quite speficially that Riot said during Veigar's rework (during the mage update, I think) that the reason behind his passive changing was because it was a stupid thing for a character to have high mana costs only to justify a passive that restores mana (his passive, at the time, would give him more mana restoration based on how much mana he was missing), so they gave him lower mana costs and a passive that fits his playstyle. Quite some time after, Lissandra got her passive changed into the current one (her previous one would give her a free ability cast).

So now, I think Xerath deserves the same treatment. I mean, Xerath isn't in the greatest spot right now, he isn't the worst by any means, but his passive is just so boring an uninteresting. A basic attack that restores mana, not only does that make little sense for his playstyle, considering he is ability oriented mage with really long ranges, but its also just another ability that justifies high mana costs. The basic attack doesn't even get additional range or anything, its literally just mana restoration. Considering that Riot has expressed their discontent with that type of passive, I really think that needs to change.

**EDIT:** To all those saying that Xerath's passive is meant to balance him, by giving him a reason to approach enemies, I can understand that, but, remember that Lux and Ziggs, while being characters with long ranges, and also need to get closer to use their passives, they get damage for it, with Ziggs' one being excellent for turrets and Lux for champions and last-hitting. They don't have anything that weakens them just so the passive can compensate them for it, they only get an addition to their kits. The problem with Xerath is that he doesn't just get something from his passive, he loses something on his kit and then has the passive compensate for it, which means that its not an addition, if feels more like the nullification of a forced weakness. Maybe if his passive caused his abilities to deal more damage from shorter distances or if his basic attack restored health or gave him a shield, he would be getting something instead of just compensating for a number weakness that could easily be removed, just like Veigar and Lissandra.",2019-09-17 20:49:36
135,Doing well in League is often defined by making the game as miserable as possible for other players.,0,d5jlhh,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/d5jlhh/doing_well_in_league_is_often_defined_by_making/,14,1568767392.0,"So, reading that recent post of “counter jungling is like real life bullying”, it got me thinking...It’s kinda the same thing in lane too, and is indicative of how to best play to win. If you can bully someone out of lane or keep them from CSing at all, you’re doing well! Conversely, you’re basically removing that person’s ability to play or even have fun. Now, if you’ve gone and fed 5 kills to your lane opponent and cry about being behind, that’s a different story. However, some players are mechanically better at the game or pick favorable matchups that give them a strong edge, and if that edge is used correctly, they’ll get ahead and stay ahead all laning phase, and possibly make the laner irrelevant in late game. So not only could they not play all lane phase, but get deleted instantly in team fights, unless they do some serious catch up work or play well from behind (though any decent player will stop them from farming all game if necessary).

Anyhow, I bring this up because I saw a lot of comments bemoaning how when they steal the enemy’s entire jungle, they are only a level ahead or so and can’t abuse them further. I know it’s nice to reward your risks with a level advantage, but...You really want to make life that miserable for that person? It’s not good enough that you’re a level or 2 ahead, with a severe item advantage, but you want them just to not be able to play the game AT ALL? That feels kinda...awful, I dunno. I mean, thank god catch up experience does exist or I imagine the jungle role would be avoided like the plague, or that people would just stop playing all together.

If you are truly better at the game, you will win regardless. It may not happen 100% of the time, but it will happen more often than not. I feel like the inherent bullying and entitlement actually can lend to the toxicity embedded in the game, so...I dunno, just remember there’s some other people on the end of that Xin, Fiora or Kassadin you’re destroying, who’s probably being verbally abused by their team at that moment. Do they really need to be made completely invalid because of your superiority, or can you just agree that catch-up mechanics don’t ruin the lead you created because they dare approach your champion level?

137,Noob’s guide to getting into Gold,38,d5jj7d,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/d5jj7d/noobs_guide_to_getting_into_gold/,14,1568767099.0,"First off, if you’re in a higher tier, this is not for you. This is for us ‘tr@sch playars’, low el00, etc.

**TLDR** at the bottom.

To get things straight, I’ve played for 4 seasons, being hard stuck in bronze for a long while, mechanically being slightly better than a potato. That hasn’t changed and probably won’t, since I am not getting any younger. This season I decided to try-hard and got ito gold in about 100 games, with a winrate of 55% after trolling my placements like an idiot and being placed in Iron3.

This leads me to the first point, which is champions: I’ve decided my golden rule is max 1 skill-shot per champ: eg: Morgana\[OK\], Ezreal\[NOT OK\], Sona\[OK\], Zoe\[NOT OK\], etc. This allows me to be consistent over different games and while it reduces the ‘wow plays’ count, I do not believe you need these to get into Gold.

Secondly, probably the most important point of all - managing loss streaks. These, as well as win-streaks, are inevitable. The problem is, on a 6-7 games loss streak, where you had no chance of saving any of these games, it is very easy to ‘slip’ one loss because of yourself. Not doing this, not tilting and winning whatever is winnable is key to climbing. E.g. let’s say your S3-65LP: 1 win and you’re at apx. 85LP (1 win from promos). 1 loss and you are now at apx. 45LP which is 3 wins from promos. Think of it differently: every match that you lose because of yourself counts double.

Which leads me to the next point - losing gracefully. Everyone will tell you how to carry games, get kills, ward (yes, please-please use your wards), but not enough people talk about knowing how to lose. If you are in a bad matchup you play the first levels to feel your opponent; you maybe even die once. What you don’t do is NOT write on all-chat “lucky noob”, but you understand your lane is ‘lost’ and you need to play safe, not give away more kills, SS when needed and try to follow the opponent on roams that will obviously lead to fights. Doing this will let your jungler focus other lanes and will, in many cases, tilt your opponent who feels ahead in doing stupid plays. These are the wins that you need to work for, unlike the ones when you are 12-2-0 on Riven top, which feel good, but also count as only 1 victory.

Yes, Riven top OP, I know right? No. My next point is on knowing when to trade kills. If you’re playing Orn and the enemy Riven is 10% HP under tower, your first thought should not be whether you could kill her, but whether you would die under that tower. What is more important - a kill on Orn or one on Riven. One on Nami support flash-igniting Draven under tower, or those adoration stacks he gets from 1 shotting you there. Let me ask you differently - how many Dravens/Rivens/Olafs, etc have you seen win games with zero kills? And how about Namis/Orns/Sejuanis? Sometimes, not feeding the enemy carries IS carrying.

Next in line: don't buy items like a bot. You're top and Aatrox is wrecking you? Don't buy more magic resist (???), how about you invest 800 gold in an Executioner's Calling and make sure you mess up that healing of his. Velkoz support keeps poking you out of lane and they also have an AP mid? Leave that Infinity Edge for later and buy a Hexdrinker.

One other controversial point is that I play with muted chat for all. However, since the new changes to /mute all, I need to manually mute people in order to still receive pings. I don’t disable chat since I want to be able to use it to write stuff like ‘jlger is bot side’, ‘their red up in 10’, ‘mid f down 4:25’. Who knows, maybe other people actually use this information, unlike me who prefers to not read people complementing each other’s skins, only to flame their parents, countries and genders 2 mins later for a botched flash.

Also, I do try and push my team to take baron after a won fight rather than taking 1 tower mid and recalling, but I’ve found that if 4 people go for something, I fight is probably gonna happen again, so I’d better be there with them instead of solo-doing-scuttle and pinging baron.

**TLDR:**

* use consistent champs
* when on losing streaks, if you can win only 1 game that would be thrown away, that is your ladder climb right there.
* control wards are like condoms - you hate buying them, but they save your life
* learn how to lose a lane gracefully
* don’t trade kills with enemy hyper-carries
* itemise smartly, not like an afk bot.
* never flame
* stick with your team even if you know the call/play is bad, if the other 4 members are on it, you need to be on it",2019-09-17 20:38:19

FPX duel it out with GRF for 1st place while SPY and CG are the ones who either get beat down or pull off upsets like C9 and Vitality last year.

Group B- G2, GAM, RNG, HKA/ FLA/ UOL
G2 vs GAM would be a great fun matchup. Also G2 vs RNG rematch from last worlds and Uzi gets to lane against the former smug mid laner now turned ADC.

Group C- SKT, C9, FNC, AHQ
Reuniting SKT, C9, and also AHQ. Also would be cool to see C9 vs FNC and FNC vs SKT. Let’s see if SKT can pull C9 out of groups again

Group D- TL, IG, DWG, JT

Wardens who are supposed to be able to protect ADCs from this, like Alistar, Braum, Taric, Tahm Kench are both pitifully underplayed in Soloqueue as well as underpowered in several cases. In addition to Relic shield being nerfed, they simply cannot protect ADCs.

Supports doing damage is nothing new. It's part of how supports can help ADCs survive until they get items, it's been around for years. What's changed is the Relic shield nerfs and the dipping popularity of ""protective"" supports.",2019-09-17 19:52:59

This would be the perfect time to reintroduce a new jungler (That's not a fucking rework of an older champ) going back to western and eastern mythos.

So, for those, who are having that difficulty, you go to the settings and go to the GAME tab, where you find "" Camera Move Speed (Mouse)"". 

Lower that value would mean more stable flick( I have mine at 9). Try it a few times until u find the right setting. Lowering the "" Mouse Speed"" also help.

 It's not making any effort to defend its skills2win proclamation. And it's not even a great advertisement.

But in all seriousness Nexus Blitz was super fun and should be brought back, and Prize Fight was my favorite part of the game since all eyes were on you and it was fun as hell to duel or 2v2.

In another thread I proposed some nerfs as a comment, but wanted to get more people's opinions, so I'm making a separate post. My proposed nerfs are as follows:

&#x200B;

Spellthiefs Edge:

* 13 bonus magic damage -> 0 bonus magic damage
* 11 gold on hit -> 5 gold on hit
* cost 400g -> cost 450g (Upgrades will cost the same so 50g less to complete)

Frostfang:

* 18 bonus magic damage -> 0 bonus magic damage
* 22 gold on hit -> 10 gold on hit

Remnant of the Watchers:

* 18 bonus magic damage -> 0 bonus magic damage
* 22 gold on hit -> 15 gold on hit

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Ancient Coin:

* gold coin 28g -> coin gold 20g
* mana coin 6% missing mana -> 10% max mana
* cost 400g -> cost 450g (Upgrades will cost the same so 50g less to complete)
* NEW: enemies can now stand on coins to destroy them, similar to zac's blobs or poppy's shield.

Nomad's Medallion:

* gold coin 50g -> coin gold 35g
* mana coin 6% missing mana -> 10% max mana
* NEW: enemies can now stand on coins to destroy them, similar to zac's blobs or poppy's shield.

Remnant of the Ascended:

* mana coin 6% missing mana -> 10% max mana
* NEW: enemies can now stand on coins to destroy them, similar to zac's blobs or poppy's shield.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Relic Shield:

* Gold on kill: full value -> half value
* Heal on kill: 5-30 based on missing health -> 30
* cost 400g -> cost 450g (Upgrades will cost the same so 50g less to complete)
* melee execute below health threshold REMOVED

Targon's Brace:

* Gold on kill: full value -> half value
* Heal on kill: 10-60 based on missing health -> 45
* melee execute below health threshold REMOVED

Remnant of the Aspect:

* Heal on kill: 15-90 based on missing health -> 60
* melee execute below health threshold REMOVED

&#x200B;

TLDR: I want to lower the amount of gold generated by supports, but more importantly, make them have to meaningfully interact with the opponent to get this gold. Currently the gold is basically free, there is no competing for resources, so I have tried to add mechanics to the targon and coin lines to make them more punishable. I think spellthiefs DOES force the support to interact with the opponent, but the bonus damage is un-necessary and the gold is too high.

Edit: Also made all the starting items 450. I feel like 1 potion in lane is enough for supports. 2 makes them feel way less punishable.

Edit 2: Gold threshold to activate quest should probably be lowered in accordance to the income changes, as that is not an aspect of support I intended to weaken with these changes.",2019-09-17 17:50:53

The voice actors aren't called back for anything else and they move onto different projects.

The League of Legends cinematic videos always felt a bit empty for that reason, with the exception of Project Hunters where Vayne actually does a monologue through out the trailer, but that's about it. I exclude champion reveals as that's a different story.

Using voice actors brings life to the cinematic video and that's what I would like to see in the future.

So I'm playing usually on supp role. If that matter, usually I'm playing with champs like lulu/morgana/janna or maokai/leona/nautilus on tank role. And even in pretty great won games I get A+-/B grade (in really rare cases I have S/S-).

I can't get what I'm doing wrong. I understand that there is different play style for clean support and tank support, as different play style for each champ, however I believe there are some best practice tactics or something. I'm always warding around, buying control wards right after first recall, trying to defend adc and if possible die instead adc. When golder is stacked I'm taking  Oracle Lens. But anyway in stats I see lack of map control.

In common I'm trying to play as supportable as possible - under this I mean that I value other players a priori more valuable than myself (without fanaticism ofc). So I feel that first problem is frequent dying commonly on tank role, because I can't leave my teammate to die alone :)

Summarizing, where is that borderline between self-sacrificing and good teamplay, what advices can you give me and maybe some links to guides/videos of great support gameplay? How is constructed that S/A/B/C grade for supports? What are your practice on that role? Don't know how much suitable is such topic here, but thanks in advance :)",2019-09-17 17:27:52

Now a population of 20 billion voidlings live in one gestalt conciousness. Now they roam the stars to find a suitable planet to terraform and claim it for themselves. They call themselves the Great Unity or for short Unity.

[Closest look i could get](https://i.redd.it/nsi4j8e075n31.png)

Passive: Gestalt Conciousness

Being a unification of countless different voidlings have granted unity psionic powers. Whenever unity uses one of their basic abilities all of its other abilities' cooldown will be reduced by 4 seconds

Their ultimate ability is to tap into other abilities. Granting them 9 skills in total. Ultimate is available by level 1.

Q: Gravity Wave / Nebula Storm / Life Siphon \[100 Mana / 80 mana / 40 mana\]

Gravity Wave = Unity unleashes a 180 degree wave with 700 range and pulls everything to it by 200 range. Deals 20/40/50/70/150 (+%60 AP) Magic damage. \[24 to 16 second cooldown\]

Nebula Storm = Unity conjures a nebula storm with a 600 radius which deals 10/20/40/80/100(+%40 AP) Magic damage per second for 5 seconds. This will burn mana from enemies equal to the damage dealt. \[16 to 12 second cooldown\]

Life Siphon = Unity tethers an enemy in a 900 range and siphons life. Dealing 20/40/60/80/100(+%50 AP) and healing for the same amount dealt for 5 seconds. \[10 seconds to 4 second cooldown\] Cannot tether the same enemy twice. If the enemy is inside of the Nebula storm also restores mana equal to half the damage.

W: Gravity Falls / Nebula Fluxiation / Sacrifice \[120 Mana\] \[100 mana\]\[%20 percent of Max HP\]

Gravity Falls = Unity uses gravity to conjure a meteor which falls down in a 700 range line. It deals 100/150/200/250/300 (+%80 AP) Magic damage. \[24 second to 16 CD\]

Nebula Fluxiation = Unity manipulates a nebula cloud with electricity and sends a tornado in a 800 range, knocking enemies up for 0.5 seconds. After staying at the target location for 1 second the nebula cloud returns to Unity's location. It deals 60/80/100/120/150 (+%40 AP) Magic damage each time it hits. \[16 CD\]

Sacrifice = Unity Sacrifices %20 percent of its total Health to gain the same amount of Mana. It also gains a shield equal to  half the amount for 3 seconds. Cannot cast if health is below %20 percent. \[No cooldown\]

E: Wormhole / Infinite Mass / Psionic Blast \[80 Mana\] \[40 Mana\] \[120 Mana\]

Infinite Mass = Unity increases the mass of its being bending space and creating a zone of 500 radius that stuns enemies. When the enemy is displaced or uses a movement skill, the enemy is stunned for 1 seconds and take 70/80/90/100/120 (+%70 AP) damage. \[24 second CD\]

Wormhole = Unity bends space and teleports 600 units over 0.5 seconds. If unity casts Gravity wave while teleporting, when it arrives it will cast the gravity wave 360 degree and will pull further (400). \[18 CD\]

Psionic blast = Unity uses its psionic powers to knock enemies back in a cone shape by 300 units, disarming them for 0.5 second. If its cast when inside a nebula storm it will turn into a 500 radius psionic blast. It deals 60/80/150/180/240 (+%60 AP) magic damage. \[20 seconds to 12 seconds\]

R : Gestalt Conciousnes \[No mana\] \[No cooldown\]

Switches unity's spells.

They want agency, and to not be completely dependent on support and team in order to make anything happen (on a different topic if they do change adc agency I hope they make it so supports don't mostly have such ADC focused support skills). But, the ADC is still the highest dps and most reliable damage on a team. If your damage is super reliable and unmissable, you can't be too free to run around on your own because then if you got ahead you could just mow everyone on the map down.

So, ADC players, what do you want to give up for better agency? Do you want better defensive itemization, so you can sacrifice dps? Because I often see marksmen refusing to ever build a defensive item, even boots. Do you want less reliability to your autos, like bringing back dodge chance? Do you want to give up late game power for an earlier spike? 

TLDR, ADCs have no agency and that feels bad. But as long as they have super high dps, super reliable damage, and fantastic late game power they can't really have much agency. What do you want to sacrifice for agency?",2019-09-17 16:52:46

There's the excuse of variant skins not going on sale because of reasons, but that's all coming from the community and of course there would be solutions to that problem as well.
 
Bottom line: 
We have nothing official! Riot announced early on in the year that they wanted to try things regarding sales but in fact everything stayed basically the same, except for Leona's sale being skipped without any statement about it. Has it been postponed? Has it been cancelled and why?
AskRiot has given any answer and neither has the support.

TLDR at bottom.  


I have been playing League for over seven years now ( i started in season 2) and since i started actually tryharding and grinding in ranked(season 5) i somehow started losing the ability to have fun by playing. 

Back in the days, before i grinded for ranked, i was silver and played myself to gold. That was all what i wanted to achieve. It was back then when we decayed in silverand could demote to bronze because of this(i think but decay was real). I played a lot more normals, it was a time when League and Minecraft were my fav. games. I met friends in minecraft and played LoL with them. But as the times changed, i lost these friends. At some point, i was all alone in the web. And so I started playing ranked.

It was a miracle, it was addicting it was fun. It felt good, i was a jungle main since season 3 but it felt like i was more. It felt like i had power. But young me could not really handle the power. I got to plat 5 in that season, followed by a permanent ban because of my attitude and another account to plat5. I was happy and sad. I reached my peak, but i lost something dear to me, and a lot of money (500€ for a 15 years is not small). But i said, i will flame less and continued in Season 6. Ah yes season 6 it had it's things. 2 months into the Season and i was permanently banned again. Immature me did learn nothing, but i couldnt resist it, getting flamed for every single mistake i did. I got that feeling of do everything right or do nothing in your life at all. So i started trying to become one of the best if not the best (PS im not). So i played and got to D flippin 5, i was nuts saying everyone how good i am. I was one of the top 2%. But i could not get higher, and in a game where i got placed toplane, that i hardinted because i can not play that role. toxicity got the best of me, and yea banned. I told all my friends and folks i played with "" ah just doing another smurf you know wanna learn a new role and not lose too much mmr"" yea sry for the lies. Season 7 started to get better. I matured rapidly and wasnt even quite as toxic anymore. Sure some chat restrictions but no ban, not even a tempban, i reached d5 and was satisfied with my overall performance, but all in all not good enough. I played a lot more normals that year, i met some new friends with whom im still befriended today. And i had finally another game again: WoW. WoW took a lot of time and that means less time in LoL less time being toxic. Fast forward Season 8 Ardents woo, yea nothing much happened here D4 was my peak. Liked the meta. Did not like the reworks. 

And in summer, i got together with my gf. My whole life changed. She was the centre of my attention. We played Borderlands, Dead by Daylight, League, Stardewvalley, and many other games(at least others that her pc could handle). But some of these games became unplayable on her pc. And now league is everything we have whats actually fun for both of us. But these scars I have because of LoL are slowly showing. I get tilted way too often now a days. Tilttype Paladin btw, whenever someone does stupid things my mentallity goes from good to bad in a second, ""they are trolling me on purpose"" ""turk transfers running it down on euw again"" ""first time a champ in ranked yey ffs"" and thoughts like these. The problem is, they also occur in normals. Someone plays something offmeta i blame the loss on him. Someone has a bad game or a lane he cant win, what a damn troll. I wish my brain could let lose and see it is a normal. People are trying to have fun here, and dont necessarily win. It is just, that i personally get the most enjoyment out of a win. 

My gf hasnt really played much league in the last 6 months. Which resulted in her performing worse now, but it is no big deal. She is allowed to play bad. Yet my winrate with her in normals is at 15% or so. I just want to win, i want to have fun. But i wish i could sepperate these 2 things. League is my hobby, and league is basically what defines me. A friend of mine defines himself through WoW. 

All im saying is, i unlearned how to have fun. And i am desperately trying to learn it again. It feels like a broken relationship, the memories and the feeling is there, but it is not possible. If anyone of you have/had a similar situation or knows what i can do, except taking time off i will most likely continue to play ) i will gladly hear you word.

TLDR: Playing league is not enjoyable for me anymore, while winning is and i would like to change that.",2019-09-17 15:36:25

Should he just continuously dodge over and over again until he gets the role? In ranked, this means steadily losing LP for each dodge because the game keeps trying to force roles and in turn champions on you that you're not interested at all and especially not good at.

&#x200B;

You're not even promised to get one of the two selected roles, I queue for jungle and top and I get support or bot. I would even settle with being auto-filled once so then be guaranteed a role I want the next few games, but no; you only get guaranteed ONE of the two queued roles, so it's not even that good.

&#x200B;

Wouldn't an objectively better system be the one that tells you the queue times for different roles, then giving the players the option to fill a role if they want to enter a game as soon as possible if they wanted to? Rather than forcing it on them and punishing them afterwards for not playing roles they would rather not play the game at all, than to play those roles?",2019-09-17 14:06:48

So what did G2 reach yet? LEC spring split finals winner in record time. However this result is also vs a team that didn’t even qualify for playoffs in summer split. Yes, they looked much better in spring, however they showed in summer that they can’t really handle pressure. So how much is this “record-time” actually worth?

MSI winner. Yes, this is something they managed to do which is impressive. However the only strong opponent they won against was SKT and the whole match was really close. You can’t say for certain that G2 is ahead of their competition. (We saw at rift rivals that all EU teams can beat TL in a for fun event for them) You also can’t really pull the IG card here. IG played like shit in their match vs TL. This isn’t their typical strength. If IG plays like they normally do, they would have won there. (Just a fact: IG won vs. G2 twice in groups) So overall the status of MSI winner is at least questionable. It’s great, don’t get me wrong here..But there was a lot luck involved.

Summer split: They won 6-4 in incredible close matches where they made fewer mistakes than Fnatic. (This river bush ward from Broxah kinda threw the game) Overall: deserved winners but with questionmarkes involved, compared to international competition.

So before you start calling me a salty Fnatic fan, read my reasons again and tell me why I should trust G2 when it comes to worlds. All I want is a strong showing from Europe, idc about FNC, G2 it Splyce.",2019-09-17 13:55:56

This current patch however Rito has achieved balance quite well and there are various viable strategies now. All fun to play...

With upcoming launch of Kaisa into TFT, it makes me wonder why the devs are falling into the trap to New Champs, then imbalance and patches to balance....instead focusing more on other aspects of TFT. Like Post-Game stats screen, or more map types, reducing so many of the reported bugs or even cosmetic changes. Champ variety isn't a shortcoming of TFT as of now...

Also, the game has become very hard to play from behind now. The damage after level 4 is so damn high! This is the stage when all your loss streaks start cashing in and you're just a little bit away from a grand turn around and you know it.....but then you're matchmade with the top two guys with almost complete comps and you're dessimated with 30-40 damage in just 2 matches....

Either the matchmaking has to be made a bit fairer so that bottom guys aren't matched with the topmost...or the damage at level 4 needs to be nerfed.",2019-09-17 13:27:24

I've come to realise there is an unspoken rule that when I duo with a marksman we always honour each other. It doesn't matter how good or how bad you played that game - you always honour each other.

It just doesn't seem to happen when you queue alone.

Support is one of the most ridiculous roles to play. You're purposefully giving up the farm, sacrificing experience, you'll probably never get the items you want, and if you carry - your marksman will get honoured.

A primary reason that the role sucks so hard is that there's really no incentive to take all the abuse and none of the glory - except the fact that it's really fun to play support.

So I am introducing what I'm calling ""the unspoken rule"" that a marksman and support should always honour each other. Even if they're really freakin' bad that game - it's the unspoken rule.

So, I have this friend who started playing League on her own. She plays a bunch of games and has played four years of Heroes of the Storm so she understands the concept of MOBAs.

She's doing fairly well in bot matches. Against beginner and intermediate bots, she can get 20+ kills with 2 or 3 deaths and generally has no problem.

But when she plays Normal matches... I dunno, it can be a bit frustrating. Realistically, and in an ideal world, she has only played the game for a little bit over a week so she should be pitted against similarly skilled players, but these players often seem to exceed that. By quite a bit!

I sometimes queue Normal Blind and Draft with her (edit: on a new account I created just for playing with her) and I notice it myself. I often see players who'd comfortably sit in Silver. There's no way these guys would be similarly new at the game.

I understand this would be because of smurfs but it just seems too prevalent. Is MMR that whacky in League?

Anyway, the real question is, what's the best way to make the learning experience easier? I see her frustrated sometimes and it's disappointing that there's such a steep learning curve in this game, so I'd appreciate any advice to make the game's barrier to entry a little less punishing and a bit more fun.

If this was back in the old days, I'd suggest to her to play Crystal Scar to mix things up while learning what each champion does, but... that mode is no longer there. I suppose there's ARAM and the Twisted Treeline?

Edit: Sorry! I forgot to say that the account I use to play with her is also new, so I don’t interfere with her MMR.",2019-09-17 08:40:50

* Usually, nobody helps you bc everybody else is only focused on his own lane/problems. IF someone comes to help, the bully either runs away like a coward or brings his aggressive friend to the battle. 

* If your teammates are real pricks, they will actually blame *you* for failing this game

* Don’t you dare to complain ingame, or every enemy will just laugh at you. Complaining isn’t cool. You are expected to shut up and suffer. 

* You can report everything to the police, but often the counterjungler has technically not committed a crime, so they won’t do anything... (well, at least RL police often will actually act on *actual* crimes).

We all know that Ning got benched after IG vs LNG. I saw many people here are thinking that he got benched because he has a shit attitude and has not been getting along with theshy/JKL for some jealous reason.

As a fan of Ning, I agree Ning’s behavior recently is super unstable to the team because Rookie is no longer that strong to support his aggressive style in summer series. It is wise to bench him. But I can’t believe these stupid rumor personally. Luckily, I can read Chinese a little bit, I tried to dig the origin of these rumor in Chinese internet communities such as Weibo tieba and nga. Then I find something interesting but disgusting I think I have to share. My mother language is neither English nor Chinese, please forgive my poor English translation.

There are two main rumor about Ning:

1 shit attitude towards scriming and ranking because he is in relationship with someone.

2 personal issue with theshy/JKL

Scrim itself is kind of secret that no one knows the detail. Such rumor is very difficult to clarify or make sure. At least, I can’t see any evidence so far, I choose to take it as rumor before I see evidence. As for ranking amount, if you know Ning, **he is always like that**. He believes as a jungler, ranking is not that important compare to revising the matches. And believe or not, the person who has least ranking amount is JKL, not Ning.

As for theshy, even after benching, fans witnessed that he was waiting for Ning to go back hotel together after IG vs JDG, so I can’t believe they have bad relationship.

Let’s go back to my digging. I will try to summary them briefly.

All these rumor firstly come from an ID called “H” in Weibo, but so many evidence showed that this ID is just a smurf of “N”. Then things become extremely interesting because the latter is scandal girlfriend of JKL. Despite her deny, claiming she has a boyfriend, she is on the list of JKL’s friend on weibo(that is very distinguishing unlike English speaking country), she has couple wear with JKL, they play PUBG together so many times, she live in same hotel as JKL during S8, and her lol ID is something like “goodnight sweetie Jackie” if I have to translate. Please notice that this girl not only say something ill about Ning, but also spread so many bad rumor about Baolan starting from he got benched at the beginning of summer series like he is girlish, he decided to bench himself because he hates Ning and waiting for new jungler(this one definitely is lie at least) Baolan also has shit attitude towards scriming etc. So when fans started to believe it was JKL who told her these and some people were blaming JKL shouldn’t deal this arguing among teammates in this way, another girl shows up claiming that “N” and JKL is innocent because she is the person told all these rumor to N. 

This girl I’d like to call her “S”, she is good friend of one JKL’s close friend A who said S is the most beautiful girl he’s ever seen. The ridiculous thing is both N and S are also close friend of IG’s new jungler Leyan. Leyan’s ex-girlfriend used to complain about these two girl speak ill of her which lead to her break up with Leyan. I have to mention that S’s lol ID were “hold me in Leyan’s arms” and “JKL’s cutie wife”.  

Above all, I feel very disappointed and disgusted, I have no interested in digging anymore. Apparently, JKL and Leyan are somehow unsatisfied with Ning maybe Baolan as well, and they choose to say something terrible about them to their friends (maybe gf) and let them to spread on internet. Now they are succeed. IG’s Chinese fans hate these two guys especially Ning which even inbred some much more horrible rumor like Ning behaves terrible because of gambling etc. In my opinion, no matter the rumor are truth or not, as a pro, you should deal with personal issue personally and privately. Choosing such way to ruin teammates’ reputation is really dirty dog. At the same time, I also realized IG’s management is far from a professional club, they have had so many chance to clarify but they did nothing.

 I think will never be a fan of Invictus Gaming anymore. Here I attached link of all the evidence.

I remember playing during 2010 or so where you would aggro against enemy champions and 4-5 minions could take you to 50% HP at level 2-3. Now that was absurd damage but I think bringing back meaningful minion damage to champions would be a healthy way to ""nerf"" lane bullies.

If you are strongly counterpicked, you're the one falling back and usually fighting where your ranged minions are or even behind them. If you're melee against a ranged top, you're hovering behind your ranged minions and will immediately take damage if you try to cs. If minion damage against champs was buffed, I think the counter pick or lane bully playstyle would be less toxic.

I don't even think of minion damage anymore unless it's a wave of 12+ minions then you get scared but the usual 6 minion wave I don't think anyone cares about minion damage when trading with the enemy.

And that's not even counting the number of times I've been playing with friends and it's screwed them over!  And suddenly, when doing some reading for my AI class, I came across this algorithm that looks like it provides paths that in my opinion line up much better with what I would expect from them.  This algorithm is called greedy-best-first search, and here's an image illustrating what I'm talking about:

&#x200B;

[The star is the start location, the X is the end location, and the white line is the path the champion would actually take.](https://i.redd.it/zkauj1z8d2n31.png)

Now this obviously wouldn't completely remove the issues with league's pathfinding, as can be seen in this illustration the character would get right up next to the wall and then walk around it, meaning it would take a little longer to get there, and make you hug the wall on your way there.  My proposed fix for the fact that it's not quite as efficient of a path as an A\* search for example would be to make this the default pathfinding for clicking on the screen, and keep the current one (probably A\*) as the default pathfinding for clicking on the minimap.

&#x200B;

And this isn't the end all be all of the issue, you're still going to end up going around the wall, but it does help you get closer to the wall to line up for hard flashes, riven 3rd Qs, etc, and overall I think it would be a really nice quality of life change.  In an ideal world Riot would allow people to change the pathfinding they use, between the normal A\*, greedy-best-first, or even just walking straight towards the point where you clicked regardless of walls/obstacles in the way, but I get that it would likely take a lot of time and effort to set up and Riot has a lot of other projects they're working on, but I think it might be worth considering as a quality of life change at some point in the future.

&#x200B;

TL;DR:  Greedy-best-first search (see picture) might make pathfinding closer to what one would expect.",2019-09-17 06:25:20

***Current iteration of Guinsoo’s Rageblade***



**Recipe**: Pickaxe, Blasting Wand, Recurve Bow, and 790 gold

**Gold Cost**: 3100

**Stats**: 25 AD, 25 AP, 25% bonus AS

**Effect/s**: Grants 15% Hybrid Penetration (Unique Passive); AA’s deal 15 bonus Magic Damage and grant a stack of 8% bonus AS per AA, grants **Phantom Hit** (applying all On-Hit effects twice in an AA in .15-sec delay) occurring every 3rd AA at max 6 stacks. Melee Champs instantly trigger Phantom Hit at max stacks.


***My concept of the Item Rework***



**Recipe**: Pickaxe, Blasting Wand, Recurve Bow, and 875 Gold

**Gold Cost**: 3600

**Stats**: 30 AD, 50 AP, and 30% bonus AS 

**Effect/s**: Grants 7-15% (Based on level) Hybrid Penetration (**Unique**); AA’s deal 20 bonus Magic Damage (**Unique**); **GUINSOO’S STACKING RAGE (Unique)**: Grants .75% bonus AS per unit killed, up to 60 (45% bonus AS upon completion); **RAGE FULL (Unique)**: Upon completion, gain ***Guinsoo’s Ferocity*** effect occuring every 3rd AA. **GUINSOO’S FEROCITY (UNIQUE)**: Deals (40% Bonus AD and 40% AP) Adaptive On-hitDamage. Can critically strike for 100% (+25% from IE) bonus damage but doesn’t work vs structures. The passive 20 on-hit Magic damage won’t crit. Works on abilities that apply On-hit effects.



Why do I think it should be reworked again?

-So that it will be more rewarding for Champions who are recommended on with this item. It will also be more rewarding for players who farm a lot by having a permanent stats and effect, unlike the current iteration where it has 4-second timer when not AA’ing. 


Would it be more broken than its current iteration?

- Probably not, although it will give slightly more stats than its current iteration, and it’s also more expensive yet more Gold-efficient than its current iteration.

- Yasuo might benefit from this Item since his Q applies Guinsoo’s Ferocity. Therefore, probably yes.

Edit: Changed from Phantom Hit effect to Guinsoo’s Ferocity Unique effect on reworked concept

I'm not here to rant about whatever, this isn't a call to action, I simply have a proposal and would like to present it for feedback.   

The information is all verifiable; the game *knows* which champions are being hovered, because it warns you before banning it. So if someone bans a hovered champion, an icon should appear next to their name and teammates should be able to report them. This icon should not appear unless a hovered champ is banned.  

The reporting party should then be able to dodge with losing 1 LP and the six minute dodge timer. Dodging with a 1 LP loss makes it so there is some punishment for repeated dodging and false reporting, but also doesn't place an unnecessary concern on the reporting party. Additionally, a six minute dodge timer isn't unbearable, and almost guarantees you won't pair up with the same player who created the issue. After all, 99% or more of players respect the hover, and the chance that you'll match up with that one player, out of tens of thousands or more at any one time, is pretty damn slim.  

Like all reportable offenses, punishments should increase in severity with frequency. Like, the first time or two it happens the player should receive a written warning, then a three day ban, then a 14 day, then a perma. So you really have to be a repeated asshole to get banned for this. Additionally, I have to wonder if it is possible to code a ranked queue ban only - wherein a summoner can be banned from ranked queue whilst still being able to play norms/blinds. This would add several more progressive tiers of punishment before the ban hammer comes down.  

Well, that's my piece. Do with it what you will.",2019-09-17 05:03:10

In most of my games, there'll be those 1/2 person(s) who sabotage the team.   
It's fine playing games like these, but on small regions like OCE where we see the same players every now and again, it's turned into a circus when the same players are losing us games.  
And an example of this is that I played a game with a teammate that I had been matched with in a few games previously (different days) and much like those last games, we lost (they fed, flamed, sabotaged etc.). 

Wouldn't a report option like ""unskilled player"" be useful in these circumstances?

we all have off games, but when we have to play with people who constantly lose, (even to people an entire rank below them), I think it should be then that being bad becomes a reportable offense.

I can't play the game anymore because there is always a dude with 85% winrate on one team and he hard stomps the game, when I win it's not because of my team, just the smurf, same for when I lose. It's unplayable, I don't know what the policy about smurfing is exaclty but apparently plat 1/ diamond 4 is only a playground for smurfs and it's very tilting. I understand now why people are so toxic, they can't decide if they win or not, or only once in 15games so they don't care about the game anymore and just soft int everygame.

* You can die while collectiong jungle marks and it is sucks if you are behind.Thats mean you never gonna get those marks without siegeing


* People kill your marks immediately when they spawn if they are not stupid.Thats why I have never win any game with her above Plat IV.If your marks are not above ten you don't do shit in game.Your range is low and you have to stack four kill to increase your range only by 75.It says max gives 250 range but I haven't seen anyone could stack that much.So it is unnecessary.Also note that you can't select same target before four min pass.


* Her ulti doesn't have any advantage over you.It heals BOTH tarket and it makes invulnerable BOTH side.How you gonna win with this ulti seriously? Maybe if you E enemy and hit third mark after ulti end.But this is not always happens and if your E is on cd you are finished.


* Don't even have proper build path.You can pretty much build anything but it doesn't mean it does gonna be effective with every build.

Two humans with three bot allies can win if one of the humans is a pro, one human with four bots may as well dodge and wait for five minutes before trying again and getting the exact same situation.

It's not even like in heroes of the storm where you only get bot allies if you've been in the queue too long (and even then they are official bots). The existence of these bots makes the queue times shorter so if you're playing at a time when fewer humans are on you're even less likely to run into another human.

Maybe this wouldn't be as bad if you could queue again immediately after dodging - can this be a rule just for versus AI please?

In that game, there is a Elite Specialization (basically like an Advanced Class) called the Chronomancer who supports their teammates by accelerating their cooldowns. For the last few days, I kept coming back around to how I'd love to see that idea implemented into a champion in League of Legends. I very much doubt this post is going to gain any traction or have any influence in bringing that kind of thing to the game, but at times like these I really need to just to concept it myself so I can get my ideas out and see if anyone even thinks it sounds fun. So here I am.

By the way, feel free to post your own version of a champion who plays like this! I'd love to see them. 

Anyways, without further adieu...

**Kronos - The Time Echo**

***LORE***

I don't want to spend a lot of time on this (spent most of it on the abilities), but suffice to say that Kronos would be a scientist who conducted an experiment which fragmented him across time. Despite being scattered like this, all of his parts remain connected, making him effectively a sort of time ghost who pops in and out of existence on a whim. He can exercise control over his fragments in order to cause shifts in time, sort of like a butterfly effect. Far from changing events though, these interferences create anomalies at different points in time. While this initially causes a lot of problems for other people, he eventually learns to keep it under control. He enjoys all of this power as not only has it granted him a seemingly neverending existence, but the ability to study both the future and past at his leisure, which satisfies him as an academic. It also soothes his ego, which is why he decided to ditch his old boring name and adopt the title of Kronos, a benevolent god of time (in his words). 

***ROLE***

Primary: Mage

Secondary: Support

***STATS***

*Note: I'm not super committed to really thinking through numbers, definitely function over elegance, consider them more as estimates than hard numbers.*

Health: 650 - 2300

Health Regen: 7 - 15

Mana: 500 - 1000

Mana Regen: 10 - 30

Range: 650

Attack Damage: 65 - 105

Attack Speed: 0.625 (+0 - 35%)

Armor: 40 - 80

Magic Resist: 30 - 75

Move Speed: 335

----------------

***ABILITIES***

**Passive - Siphoning Time**

Kronos cannot gain health except through growth, instead every 7 Bonus Health he gains is converted to 1 point of Ability Power. 

In addition, once per second when out of combat, Kronos generates a stack of ""Echoes"", which can increase to a limit of 120 over two minutes. When Kronos performs a basic attack upon an enemy champion and he has more than 15 stacks, these stacks are consumed, and deal 0.25-2.5 (based on level) (+1.25% Ability Power) bonus magic damage per stack.

---------------- 

**Q - Anomaly - Range: 800 | Width: 75 | Speed: 1750 | Cooldown: 15 /13.5 /12/10.5/9 | Cost: 90/85/80/75/70 Mana**

Kronos fires an orb along a line. When it collides with any target or structure, a mark in the shape of a ring appears around them. Champions, monsters, epic monsters, or minions hit by this ability immediately suffer 5/10/15/20/25 (+20% Ability Power) magic damage. Regardless, over the following three seconds after the ability connects, this ring compresses. All damage the target suffers during that three seconds (including the damage caused by the ability itself) is reapplied at the end of this channel.

If Kronos's Passive is used on the target at any point during the marks countdown, Kronos gains the damage dealt (pre-mitigation) as Grey Health.

----------------

**W - Timestream - Cost: 115/105/95/85/75 Mana | Target Range: 1200 | Width: 600 | Speed: 1200 | Cooldown: 12 (after ability completes)** 

Kronos sends out a wave of temporal energy which bounces back and forth once after reaching maximum range. Allies hit by this ability (including Kronos) have all of their active cooldowns decreased by 0.75 seconds, and enemies have all of their active cooldowns increased by 0.75 seconds. Enemies additionally suffer 15/30/45/60/75 (+25% Ability Power) Magic Damage. Both effects apply per times which they connect. Kronos additionally gains 3 ""Echoes"" stacks for each time each target, allied or enemy, is hit.

----------------

**E - Temporal Trail - Cost: 70/65/60/55/50 Mana | Cooldown: 26/24/22/20/18 Seconds**

Kronos charges (but is not disarmed) for 5 seconds, leaving a ghostly trail based on where he moves, gaining decaying bonus movement speed based on (100% Ability Power), and saving the current status of all of his cooldowns (except for this ability). At the end of the five seconds, all of his other cooldowns are reset to their previous values and Kronos will retrace his steps at the same speed. During this period, Kronos remains targetable, but cannot be afflicted by any type of crowd control and remains free to use abilities and attacks (which do not interrupt his movement). He also heals for 75% of his Grey Health over the five seconds it takes him to return to his initial position.

----------------

**R - Well of Fragmented Spacetime - Cost: 120 Mana | Target Range: 700/900/1100 | Effect Radius: 1000 | Cooldown: 150/120/90 | Duration: 10 Seconds**

Kronos creates an altered zone of time at the target area. Allies standing within this zone will have their cooldowns decrease 1.5x faster, and enemies within this zone will have their cooldowns decrease 1.5x slower. In addition, Kronos's other abilities will gain additional effects when they are utilized within the zone.

*Passive: When the passive connects with an enemy within the zone, they are stunned for 1.5s.*

*Q: Enemies are trapped within the Rift for as long as the mark lasts.*

*W: Enemies are rooted for 0.75 seconds the first time they are tagged by a wave, and gain a 25% slow for 0.75 seconds for each time afterwards.*

*E: The duration of the ability is extended for as long as Kronos remains in the well, allowing the trail for the rewind to grow longer (including in the time it takes to rewind to the initial position) and pausing the bonus movement speed at its current value. Note that the Grey Health regenerates at the same pace regardless of the ultimate amount of time it takes Kronos to return to his initial position.*

----------------

And that's it. I've got this concept to a place I'm mostly comfortable with it. What do you think? Do you think a mage/support who plays around with cooldowns is a good idea? It's a mechanic that hasn't really been explored much, and only really on Zilean's self-casted E. 

I do fear I may have given him a bit too much damage, but that was actually the one place where I was incredibly mindful of the numbers. I also fear I may have made him a bit too much like Pyke, but considering that he's designed to be played with Ancient Coin instead of Spellthief's (since he really needs to hold his autoattacks), it felt like a necessity to do that. Especially so he can go down a more supportive item path with stuff like Redemption.

But that's enough of my rambling, any thoughts from any of you? I had a lot of fun making this, I don't have super high hopes (especially since I am in no way an artist), but I do kind of hope this post picks up some traction so I can discuss it with other people. Either way, at least I'm creatively satisfied!",2019-09-17 02:32:33

I started playing champs like Fiora, Camille and Riven and decided to move to top lane. It was great at the beginning of the season because I could learn top against lower elo top laners because my top positional ranking was lower than my mid ranking. 
When they got rid of positional ranking, I was still learning my way around top lane matchups and didn't feel confident enough to play ranked from my new role. So I've spent all season chilling in gold learning top in norms.

For example, back in Season 2 or 3, it may have taken weeks of constant play master a specific skill, or finalize the best item build. Find the most efficient jungle route etc etc. - But over time people share their knowledge, people follow it, and some crazy good skill that took you weeks to learn, everyone else can now master in a few days.

Thanks to this, I am wondering how present day ranks compare to those in the past? Such as Gold today. How does that compare to Season 2 ranked play? Is the skill level equiavelene to Plat in Season 2? Diamond? Challenger? Pros? etc etc.

Hopefully this post makes sense. But ultimately as games age the time required to become ""efficient"" or ""effective"" slowly decreases. Which ultimately means today's players are on average better than players 7 years ago. So how big of a gap is that? Could I have been in the LCS in Season 2 if I was Platinum today?

First of all, let's go with some fundamental points:1- Why the fuck should I even play this?Well, amigo, as you can guess, Swain+Sion's got really good sinergy, I mean, Sion's got a lot of cc and damage and Swain even more, but, that's not even the point. Tell me, who's even gonna expect a Sioin+Swain botlane against them? who's gonna even ban either of them? why would you even think this works if you see this in ranked douQ? There's little to no counter play to this combo as it's totally unexpected and I haven't even seen any guide to this combo before (we'll get on the point of counterplay later on)2- How does this even work?At this point you should have some serious doubts about this combo like ""how should I even play this? what do I build?"", well build-wise [I've got you covered](https://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/build/swain-sion-botlane-combo-558559), now if you want to know how to play this we'll get on with some simple tips:- First of all, always, **ALWAYS**, go directly to lane, don't leash even if your jg is like ""I won't gank you hurrdurr"", you'll get you pink ward ready and set on the edge (looking to your tower) on the bush to your side of botlane, and wait on the other edge of the bush. Sion, you'll use Swain as a bait, you can even make him say ""report supp afk"" because you're gonna stay on that bush until either the adc or supp (preferably the adc) comes close enough to your Q (Sion) and once they get close enough, they're basically dead.- Second, the Sion is always gonna do all the work, as Sion you're expected to tank, stun, deal damage (even when dead) and always protect your adc, make them focus you by any means. As swain... Just stay behind Sion, please, hit some E's and W's, even Q's if you can, but just stay behind Sion until you get lvl6 (or have your R up).- Third, always use the combo of Sion's E and Swain's W to harass the adc and make Swain scale off of the passive (crowss). All you have to do is hit a minion with Sion's E as to hit the enemy adc and slow them down and then Swain will just W him, that's all, as easy as it sounds.- Fourth, hit that thicc adc with your Q fully charged (Sion). I know sometimes it's hard to do it, but when Sion's Q is fully charged it stuns for 2.25 seconds, **2.25 SECONDS**, almost a morgana root, that and Swain hitting its E basically means that the enemy adc is **dead**.- Fifth, even if you know you can't kill them, force a trade (Sion) so Swain gets crows and scales.- Sixth, hit the E's with Swain, really, even if you have to use them once per trade, make that one E count, your makes Sion Q basically unavoidable- Seventh and continuing that sixth statement, when you hit your E wait until the root is almost gone and then use your passive and **don't ever use your passive to make the enemy move out of Sion's Q range**, it happened a lot when we were trying out this combo with my duo, that really fucks up your combos, just don do it.- Eighth and final, even if Sion dies, make Swain stay and focus the enemy adc, Sion's passive (glory in death) deals more damage than it seems at first glance and you can get one or two easy kills if both of you stay there.

Well, that's basically it, if you've got any doubts about what to do against certain match ups just use the comments section, it's there for a reason.

344,Female melee champs are more mechanically intensive,0,d56etc,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/d56etc/female_melee_champs_are_more_mechanically/,17,1568695691.0," We can roughly divide all champs into 4 categories

1) meta/stronger + difficult to play

2) nonmeta/weaker + difficult to play

3) meta/stronger + easy to play

4) nonmeta/weaker + easy to play

Now let’s look at roles.

ADC (ranged obviously)

You can find male and female champs from all categories. I’d say there is a slight bias towards female champs in the current meta. 

Ranged Support (both enchanters and mages)

This category is fully dominated by female champs. 

If you want to play a male ranged support while also having the advantage of meta and being able to master them quickly… 

Melee Support 

The tables have turned. It’s either Leona or Leona. This is the first peek of the prevalent trend we shall witness often from here on. However Leona is not difficult to play.

Ranged Mid

Mostly mages. A versatile and balanced group, you have Malzahar and Lux but also Vlad and Syndra and so on. Although the current meta doesn't favor mages in general but it treats them equally. 

Melee Mid

Mostly assassins with some toplaners passing by.

Female champs typically played here are Katarina, Akali, Qiyana, Irelia… is there a single champ who can be considered a beginner champ or a chill one like Fizz? 

Jungle

Vi is a simple melee jungler and also meta. Poppy is also easy but I haven’t seen one in a long time. That’s it. While there is a ton of easy strong melee guy champs, many of them carry jg also. 

Then we have Evelynn, Elise, Taliyah and Nidalee, none quite melee, all difficult, some extremely difficult. 

Top

Rare ranged tops are actually mages or adc. There is also Quinn who has a tiny pickup rate and is technically a marksman, and Kayle. Gnar is whatever. 

Female melee toplaners: Camille, Irelia, Riven, Fiora. Need I say more? Okay, I forgot about Illaoi. 

Male melee toplaners: a truckload of champs from all four categories, many of them able to flex jungle. 

&#x200B;

The question is why. 

Where is the female Darius? Female Jax? Female Master Yi? 

Where is the male Janna? 

&#x200B;

TL;DR There is a disbalance. 

Female melee champs are mechanically very intensive and those few that aren’t can’t carry a game.  

Almost all ranged supports are female and those few that aren’t are never meta.",2019-09-17 00:48:11

""it's free, you don't have to use it"" - this is a false premise because I used to get chests all the time before the changes. so the people who defend Riot are also defending the god damn awful scam that is called prestige skins. Change the name to ""Rich"" edition or ""I paid a lot for this"" edition.

There's nothing ""Prestige"" about throwing money at your screen.

also the entire concept of ""prestige - rare - unique"" loses it's meaning when they keep adding those boring, lazy and cheap I must add, designs to every other champion just to keep making money. not to mention Aatrox looks like a chroma, and you keep defending them. what about their latest patches? are you guys blind to the god awful nonsense balance they are doing?",2019-09-17 00:30:44

Most redditors are western viewers and do not watch us, but as someone who watches LMS a lot, the teams that we send are very solid this year. J Team has appeared to have the higher skill ceiling than peak Flash Wolves, and as the first ever LMS team in the history of LMS to adapt to the high tempo playstyle, they are a very solid contender for the top teams. I know LMS really underperformed last year, but this region has improved so much since last year, and they are the most underrated region. Especially J Team looks like they can make another Taipei Assassins Worlds Run yet they’re still being extremely underrated. They literally are the inheritors of the Taipei Assassin’s seed. Rest is one of the best toplaners in the world, and although he is no Nuguri he is in the level of players like Khan and Wunder. LMS MVP FoFo is literally the best player to have ever played in the LMS, even better than peak Swordart, Maple and Karsa, and is on the level of players like Caps, Rookie and Faker.  I’ll be very disappointed if he does not appear on the Worlds Top 20 list, although I don’t expect him to be on there due to a bias against LMS teams.

She's basically become a stat stick champion at this point and is only viable when numbers are good for her. Before people attack me saying shes viable blah blah, i love this champion, the reason i would like to see this happen for her is so that the love i have for her is spread to other people also, because atm shes a meme pick. If picked in plat or above shes just not good, and i know there is people that play her that are higher elo but its an extremely low minority. Miss fortune deserves an updated in game  version of herself that is comparable to her lore, something that she doesnt have at all currently. The supposed rework she received 4 years ago was merely a band aid to her problems, problems that she still possesses. Her kit is extremely linear and doesn't provide enough to master, this is due to the power thats locked into her ultimate. MF's ult can make or break a game depending on how well she lands it and tbh theres too much lying on her ultimate. With new champs coming out constantly with mobility spells, they can easily escape her ult or jump onto her and kill her before she even begins to pump any damage, unlike for example kaisa, miss fortune does not provide the same thing she does with her double up and autos. i'm really unsure as to what riots plans are for miss fortune as shes just a victim of being an old design at this point",2019-09-16 23:35:28

How do people still ignore after so long time that she is the best ADC in the game since her release and not complain about it ?,0,d553de,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/d553de/how_is_kaisa_balanced_how_do_people_still_ignore/,85,1568690222.0,"I’m just trying to understand what people make believe Kaisa is balanced. She is the jack of all trades and can do everything she needs to be an good ADC. 

-She has stealth

-She has an AS steroid

-She has an EXTREME long dash

-She gets a EXTREME amount of shielding when she dashes

-She has probably the best itemization in the entire league roster 

-She can build whatever the fuck she wants, which includes zhonjas, which everyone knows is a very balanced and fun interactive item

-She has percentage health damage

-She does TOO much hybrid damage which is a pain in the ass to itemize against

-She has a long range AP damage burst which even procs her passive for whatever reason ? 

-She is strong in all stages of the game and will never fall out because of her insane scaling 

-She has no counter matchup nor any weakness besides your best friend the jungler 
 
Why do people not outrage about this ? This Champion kit is so overloaded and unfun to play against once she is ahead. Why do people not complain about her even when she is released over a year with the highest pick rate in the entire leauge roster ?",2019-09-16 23:17:02

372,There is a huge scheme going on regarding name selling and club tag selling... and I'd like to expose it.,7175,d550be,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/d550be/there_is_a_huge_scheme_going_on_regarding_name/,800,1568689885.0,"I made a similar post a while ago but the information here will be a bit different, I'll put the TL;DR at the top.

&#x200B;

**Tl;dr There is a small group of people ( and when I say small I really mean small ) that are profiting hard off name selling by using bots to snatch names so players don't really have a chance to get a name they want.**

&#x200B;

# Why is this a problem?

Because name selling and club tag selling while using macros/bots is extremely unfair and giving a certain person an unfair advantage while also being profitable IRL on something that should be free.  

&#x200B;

# Example 

Person A has been wanting the name ''Tamed''

Person A waits for the day it's released and keeps clicking.

Little does Person A know, Person B ( the name seller ) is using macros and bots to guarantee they get the name over anyone else.

&#x200B;

# Proof

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/w0kc3b8atzm31.png

&#x200B;

Okay dip shit, this is just a picture of someone claiming to sell names. Where is the proof? Well Yasuomaster69, if you were to click the links ( which you shouldn't do ) for the NA names, you can scroll down and see a bunch of names.

Take these two for example.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/mdu13k1otzm31.png

If you search up their [op.gg](https://op.gg), you will see this.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/2qyq07oqtzm31.png

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/lyywddfstzm31.png

&#x200B;

Every single fucking account or name that is being sold, has no games played. You know why? Because these are new accounts made for the sole purpose of name selling. If someones name expired and someone else took the name, their [op.gg](https://op.gg) would update with their recent games. But you won't find ANY games on these accounts very rarely will there be any games. Notice their club tags? God? L9? 

Not only is the name seller hoarding all the names via macros and bots, they are also selling club tags. Now tell me, how is this one person in charge of all the names and these amazing clubs? 

If you check time to time, you will see this list of name selling is updated nearly every other day and that the names are freshly released ones.

&#x200B;

Also club tag selling.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/xdjnb2vouzm31.png

&#x200B;

To take it even a step further, I have pmed the person and even asked them how they manage to get every name.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/55i0dli9vzm31.png

For rules on the subreddit, I cannot disclose names exactly, but what I can do since there is a ''claims must require proof'' if need be I can even show a video of me messaging the exact people in question from their own links.

I have reviewed the rules of this subreddit, I have provided proof for my claims. 

I just wanted to expose this because this is unfair to the players of League of Legends. 

My only solution is to obviously restrict these people from constantly making new accounts / logging in  new accounts or randomize the timer for name release by 10-30 days instead of a certain time. There are many solutions to this and I don't know which would be the best.

Take it as you will.",2019-09-16 23:11:25

To sum this up briefly, I’m still relearning this game properly and sit in plat with no real plan to what to play or anything. Still climbing, not really enjoying it. However I used to play riven in higher diamond a few seasons ago.

I tried picking her up and it didn’t really feel like I was doing well or was relevant. Do any higherelo riven mains have any advice as to how to play her, how the tougher matchups work like Darius, and when to roam/ when to be pressuring?

I’m very good mechanically at riven, as nothing really has changed and her animation cancels are the same. However my decision making holds me back a lot on riven. I think I’m way too fed and end up just giving away gold because I’m used to the whole old riven playstyle where you could actually get away with it.",2019-09-16 21:28:42

Make it so you can buy tickets via lol client or official league website. Why?

To buy tickets you will need to be logged in on LOL client so there will be less bots (max 2 tickets per account)

After purchasing you will see your tickets only on account and you wont recive any PDF(or similar) file with ticket. 

Now you might be asking how do you access arena?

At the entrence you will need to login to their system in some kind of machine like atm.

I'm sure that it would take a lot of time to enter the arena but you would be actually able to buy tickets and it would be alot harder to resell tickets

New animations, particules, sounds and voice lanes (and probably more) feels refreshing on champions we played for years. But we also have been used to them and their base abilities animations.


As riot is putting out more and more skins all the time, I personally think that it can be kinda hard to keep up with all of them.


I’m pretty sure almost everyone has ever been in a game and being confused by a skin customised ability they did not recognise. 


We are used to the base abilities’ hit boxes, ranges, behaviour, colours, animations... I feel like we are not supposed to get surprised in game by a skin element, which might impact the course of the game.


I am obviously not saying this is the reason why your ally is 0/10 buy the 15mins, but it could have impact nonetheless.


Also I’m not even talking about those so called « P2W » skins which are kinda the embodiment of what I explained.


As skins are riot’s golden eggs, an option to force all the champions to have base skins is sure to never come up, but it would be quite nice to have.

Everyone complains about ranked(and rightfully so), but I feel like normal game's quality has been waaaay worse than ranked.

Some of the issue is normal games having the separate mmr from ranked, meaning games are onesided and not enjoyable, but that's not a huge deal compared to other things that you experience in normal games. The biggest issue in normal games is the playerbase's attitude.

You have people who will intentionally feed and go out of their way to troll games because they don't have LP on the line. They'll follow around their jungler while taking smite to make sure they ruin their game. They'll queue support and cs like an adc. They'll sit in a side lane and never leave the lane all game. They get their kicks off trying to ruin the game for teammates and make them upset, and since they don't lose LP and won't get banned, they don't care. 

Then you have the opposite end of the spectrum. People who play like normal games are worlds finals. If you don't build the meta build on an s tier champion with their most picked ruins in high elo KR, you're suddenly a ""troll"" and at best you'll get flamed the entire game and at worst they'll leave or run it down. Again, people tend to be more likely to do this in normal games since there is no LP on the line. I've had people alt f4 and never come back because I wouldn't let them get a second blue in a normal game when they're playing someone who doesn't even really need it.

The issue is also further exacerbated by the fact that you can 4 stack. So if you're playing solo and get a 4 stack, you can get a 4 stack who fits either of the types of people I stated. This makes playing the game so miserable that it's best just to quit the game.

Now most people who play normal games are completely fine. However, all it takes is 1 person to ruin the game. All it takes is that 1 person going disco nunu because they got autofilled to make the game unenjoyable for the rest of their team.

Normal games matter too. Just because you're not losing LP doesn't mean that people aren't completely wasting your time when they troll. A lot of the time I don't feel like queueing for a ranked game. I want either a quicker(ARAM) or more relaxed game, and I don't find this experience in normal games anymore. Nexus Blitz was amazing for this, but I have no idea what riot plans on doing for that.

Tl;Dr - Trolls and ragers run rampant in normal games, probably because they don't feel hindered by losing since they won't lose LP. Premades just make the problem worse.",2019-09-16 19:47:27

I'm pretty sure I'm of course not the first person to suggest this, but I really think League of Legends should add different voice packages to choose from. I'm legit getting tired of the same announcer since I've started this game back in Season 2 and it's extremely boring.",2019-09-16 19:30:02
431,Great way to improve as a player,7,d5285c,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/d5285c/great_way_to_improve_as_a_player/,3,1568676453.0,"I think that the best way to improve overall as a player is to ""challenge yourself"".  
If you are aware of what is the problem then challange yourself to fix it.   
You don't look at the map? Challenge yourself to look at the map every 15 secs and if you fail to do so in a certain game then repeat challenge untill muscle memory forces you to look at the map every 15 secs.  
You don't cs too well? Challenge yourself to get a certain amount of farm until a certain minute of the game and if you fail to do so repeat the process untill you can cs like this without noticing the fact that you have to do so.  
You get cheesed by enemy laner on level 2/3 etc? Challenge yourself to play safer, give up few cs if you have to do so but don't get killed and if you fail and get cheesed anyway then repeat the process untill you learn which champions can cheese you and until you don't get killed too early (or at all).  


I am aware that these are some baby steps but I feel like a lot of players could use this strategy to improve. if you challenge yourself enough you can become challenger one day!",2019-09-16 19:27:33

436,"With Worlds just around the corner, I created a spreadsheet of all the regions wins and losses in international competition in major tournaments since Season 2 Worlds.",97,d523yc,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/d523yc/with_worlds_just_around_the_corner_i_created_a/,48,1568675965.0,"I created a Google Sheet containing regional data of all the regions matchup records since Season 2 Worlds (all data was taken from lol.gamepedia.com). A couple of notes to be made though is that I did not pull from every international tournament, so this list is not necessarily complete. I just took what I personally thought were some of the biggest tournaments that were notable. 

Tournaments that I pulled from are Season 2 Worlds through Season 8 Worlds, IPL 5, IEM World Championship Season 7 through Season 11, All-Stars 2013 & 2014, Mid-Season Invitational 2015-2019, all Rift Rivals, and all International Wildcard Invitational/Qualifiers. 

A couple of distinctions that I would like to make is that I did not count Taiwan as part of Southeast Asia starting back in Season 2, but instead counted it as its own region. Vietnam on the other hand, I did not start counting as its own region until 2018 when it was given its own league the VCS. All wins and losses associated with Vietnam therefore come after 2018 (so Vietnam in 2017 has its wins and losses counted towards Southeast Asia).

Lastly, I have the data split into two sections. One accounts for individual game records against other regions, and the other side (BoX) accounts for any series that were played (Bo3/Bo5).

From meticulously grinding animation cancels, to studying matchups for hours just to have a chance; I've put in a lot of work. Of course, this leads me to Riven's biggest counter: Singed. He takes no effort to play; there's no way of sugarcoating it. For most champions, Riven especially, you need to practice. Put in the work. Anyone can pick up Singed and carry their way to Diamond; put the same player on Riven and they'd be hardstuck Iron IV. Who in the right mind would defend this brainlet champion? He auto-wins nearly every melee matchup - Riven especially. There's not much counterplay at all to his W, Mega Adhesive. As Riven, all he needs to do is place it and you die. That's it. Even with my Singed counter build (rush Adaptive Helm into Maw of Malmortius) there's no way I can win. I've taken to banning him every game or forcing my teammates to; while Riven mains are playing chess Singed mains are playing Cookie Clicker. Why should I be punished for having the intelligence and mechanical prowess to play Riven?",2019-09-16 19:17:59

People always say things like ''Try to master one role instead of becoming jack of all trades'', and autofill completely destroys that statement. In a game mode where everyone is supposed to play their best, i get forced to play as something that I have no experience to. 

Only argument I hear against this awful, awful system is that I would hace to wait much longer for a game. That is nothing compared to getting in a game of League, and than getting flamed by my Support, and then wait 20 mins for inevitible loss with my salty support that refuses to play it safe. 

Solution? Whenever you autofill someone, give them option to dodge the game, then give them something like 10 min. wait time before their next game, basically a one time leaverbuster.",2019-09-16 19:15:56

I am by know means a good player yet. I have an average ward score of .2/min if that puts it into perspective how bad I am at certain aspects of the game. But I was recently hard stuck silver and know full well all the common mistakes that need to be fixed for a successful climb.

I was a Kayle main before the rework that just couldn't understand why I was struggling to climb. After the rework, I couldn't really get used to her new playstyle do I picked up Ornn and certain aspects of the game that I never new existed started to click into place.

The things that win in mid gold and below are hard CC and lots of burst. It's not about being able to carry every game, it's about making sure no one on the enemy team can carry.

Vision and Wave Management don't matter in low-mid elo, I managed to hit plat without placing a single control ward and consistently having around 5.5 cs/min average. Rather than focusing on all these ""hidden mechanics"", you should be learning how to play your champion's matchups. A Darius that can stomp lane against a Gnar is always scarier than one with 7cs/min and perfect vision in lower elo.

If you fall behind in lane or you're in a rough matchup, it's ok to lose lane, just lose lane gracefully. Rather than giving your enemy 3 kills and being 30 cs down do to death timers, just get pushed under tower and give up a few cs in lane.

If you don't know how to use TP, take ignite top. TP is a rather weak summoner spell in mid elo and below, especially if you don't know how to maximize it's potential. People don't remember to account for the enemy having ignite when all inning, so you should be able to get 1-2 free kills on your enemy laner.

Help your jungler out. Learn jungle timings and help them invade if you know you win a 2v2 against the enemy top laner. Make sure they get the first scuttle on your side and they'll gank you in return.

If you die to the enemy jungler, you messed up. You overextended without wards, or you did ward and didn't look at the minimap.

If you're playing a snowbally bruiser/diver like Jax and come out of lane 0/5, DO NOT continue building damage. Build tankier items and act as a frontline for your team, so the people who didn't lose lane can deal damage without fearing for their lives.

Know your champion's power spikes, there are times in lane Ornn can 70 > 0 a Jax and times where he does no damage to him. Knowing when you're stronger than your lane opponent causes you to understand when to play aggressive or passive.

NEVER blame your team. Even if your bot lane is 0/10 by the end of laning phase, keep a strong mental and focus on what you can do to win the game. A Challenger player would've been able to carry that game, what would they do that you didn't? Focus on your mistakes instead of your team's.",2019-09-16 18:24:43

Now turned into what he once adored, Karthus roams the endless galaxy, seeking systems to annihilate and feed to his new god. A chorus of countless voices can be heard before the impeding doom he brings with his arrival, and then.... silence.""*

# Skills Visuals and Sound Effects

&#x200B;

* **Q** \- An imploding star that turns into a black hole. It would sound like the classic dark star explosion (Karma's Q, Orianna's W);

&#x200B;

* **W** \- A wall of dead contellations, using the classic dark star colors to show its ruination/corruption. Not many ideas on this, so **if you have something better, please feel free to suggest!**

&#x200B;

* **E** \- A black hole's event horizon, or a dark galaxy spinning. This is a bit tricky, cause clarity would require the visuals to not cover the ground completely, but it would mainly use dark colors as well. I imagine its sound to be horrifying, twisted. Like a chorus of screams mixed with [those sound effects rioters worked with while making DS Thresh](https://youtu.be/1h9c-O3AEkE?t=186)

&#x200B;

* **R** \- A black hole opens on top of the targets. It twitches, getting smaller and smaller, its color going from dark purple to bright red/orange as it shrinks. Finally, a blast of dark energy erupts from it as it suddendly regains its original size and colors. During all of this, the classic shadow isles fog that surrounds the target is instead a sea of stars, something you'd expect from a cosmic skin. It keeps getting darker and darker as the ult cast time runs out.Again, I imagine the sound of thousand screams to grow louder and louder as the ult charges itself, before it all fades to silence once the damage hits;

&#x200B;

* **Passive** \- Not much to say here since Karthus passive is pretty much his E and his model turned spectral. I would just recolor his model to give it that dark purple tone, but different enough to not be similiar to his E color. Dont know if anything special can be done since clarity would probably stop it;

&#x200B;

* **VO** \- The usual Dark Star filter put on top of the classic VO to give it a more cosmic horror vibe;

#

# Why Dark Star Karthus?

Well, simply put, I think Karthus would be a perfect candidate for the DS skinline, and also because I think he waited long enough for his first 1350RP skin.

As said by [notquitefrodo on twitter](https://twitter.com/notquitefrodo/status/1133437017654587392), the rioter who worked on DC Jhin's VO (`if ur reading this ily`): ""***the dark stars are extremely poetic entities (even rhaast quotes Elinor Wylie)***"".

Karthus sees beauty in death. He seeks life's end and finds joy in seeing people cross to the other side. His character has that poetic personality that makes him a perfect candidate for a Dark Star skin.

Most, if not all of his quotes (except one where he directly refers to the shadow isles so it should be removed from the skin) are absolutely perfect for the DS universe.

To quote some that, imo, would be flawless:

&#x200B;

>*""We all have a place among the divine. We have only to accept it.""*  
>  
>*""Join the chorus of death.""*  
>  
>*""Darkness envelops you.""*  
>  
>*""We are forever.""*  
>  
>*""Death is but a horizon.""*  
>  
>*""You are the candle burning unto nothing.""*  (you know.... cuz... stars....)

&#x200B;

This would also be **his first Epic Tier skin!** I personally think he could really use one since right now all he has is different remodels and Karthus Lightsbane, which is a recolor more than anything. I know that his popularity is really low, but perhaps a popular theme like Dark Star could help the sales? Let me know what you think.

Well, thats all! Thank you for reading all of this. Im sorry for the absence of visual concepts, but unfortunately I can't draw!!! I hope text will be enough to get people interested in this concept, I'd really love to see it happen someday.",2019-09-16 17:04:04

All right. PBE is all about testing and whatsoever. And if you gotta complain, you gotta complain.

I'm not gonna ask the age old question of ''Why not normal URF''  because, seemingly, everyone hates it. Instead i'm just gonna do some  observations about ARURF:

&#x200B;

* **No picks = No counterplay = No fun**

Okay, this is simple. Some people asked for an all random pick on  URF, so they wouldn't see Sonas every game (guess what, Sona is not even  that good anymore since all the nerfs they gave to supports here). But,  isn't it fun when you get 0 cc on your team (despite rerolls, because  it happens WAY MORE OFTEN than you think) and you go against Kata, Jax  and Yi at the same time? yeah, full random is so fun when both teams  have bad champions, but more often than not, people will just keep  rolling until they get an OP AF champ, which if i'm not mistaken, was  the main problem people had with blind pick URF. Which is why you see a  Jax every damn game on a (supposedly) random pick mode.

**but rerolls and champion pool are there to give more choice, besides, urf is not about strategy**

Yes but 2 rerolls per 5 means 10, plus 5 initial champs means 15  champs, which isn't even A DAMN QUARTER OF THE WHOLE ROSTER. That, and  not being able to play what you want because #random  and you instead  have to retort to picking a not so useless champ because the other team  is going to do the same and if you don't, you'll have such a bad time  trying to even get a kill. Yes miracles happen, but that's why they call  them miracles.

&#x200B;

* **Runes are useless**

Just tell me, in a game mode where early game is all about poking out  guys until you can kill them, why would you ever consider getting any  other rune than Dark Harvest? Like, it's literally the only rune that  has a significantly reduced cooldown (predator has a reduced cooldown  too BUT you can't use it from start of game unlike DH. And Aftershock is  niche anyways) Big part of the secondary runes only had numbers tweaked  AND they nerfed trascendence (which i believe didn't hurt the gamemode  as much but i'm not a developer so who knows maybe im wrong). And still,  no other runes make any sense outside of the (i think) standard  DH/Sorcery, since it's all about the dmg. I mean, guess you can't change  the runes that much since it doesn't make sense to change them just for  a gamemo- oh wait you DID CHANGE SOME OF THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE EITHER  BUSTED OR USELESS. Why not just buff the less used runes just for this  gamemode, then?

&#x200B;

* **Infinity Edge is busted**

Okay i guess this is a problem from normal 5v5 directly affecting a  gamemode anyways. Most AD champs will just buy 3 or 4 of this and 1 shot  anyone who's not a tank/bruiser/busted champion. Which makes my first  point stand out even more. Anyways, 225% crit dmg plus 25% from awesome  buff plus being able to crit 100% of the time is... well. Why even build  anything else. There are 86 finished items, and they build at best 3 of  them. In a gamemode where you can SUPPOSEDLY play anything you want and  it will be viable (i already talked about this so i won't go back to  it). I guess this is a minor concern, just nerf the damn item or  something. I guess you CAN do that at least.

**To finish**  
Not everything that represents ARURF is  as bad. Champion catapult is really damn genius, as well as gold  gaining, the nerf to healing and shields, that kind of stuff that makes  this mode unbalanced balanced fun. BUT, my point still stands. It has a  LOT of flaws, and as much as i love it, it's not fun anymore. Either  kill this like the other gamemodes, or bring back draft pick URF. We  have 10 bans in total now, it's better than S4 and S5.

Also, take this as it is. You don't have to get praised for  everything you do. It has flaws. Accept it, and do something about it.

474,IDEA: Server-wide Massive 1v1 Elimination Tournament,3,d4ztbp,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/d4ztbp/idea_serverwide_massive_1v1_elimination_tournament/,3,1568664855.0,"I came up with a gorgeous event idea: Server-wide 1v1 tournament !


**SYSTEM**

Classical single elimination format will be used, winner advances to the next round. Depending on the attendance, 15-22 rounds are expected. Round 2 is the semifinals with 4 players and Round 1 is the final.

Elimation system is very straightforward for player counts of exact powers of two (4, 8, 16, 32 etc.) For non- exact power player counts there will be a small adjustment: Some random players will start from one round higher.

Example for 100,000 player: Closest power of 2 to 100k is 65,536 (2 to the 16). So 31,072 players will start from round 16 and 68,928 players will start from Round 17. Half of the Round 17 players will advance to Round 16 and we will have a perfect 16 round bracket with 65,536 players.

**GAMEPLAY**

Standart ARAM 1v1 rules apply: First Blood, First Tower or First 100 minions to win.

Three bans for each player. All champions are unlocked.

Game count is up to preference, my suggestion is Bo3 for the first rounds, Bo5 and Bo7 for the higher rounds.


**TIME**

Games will be played each day and a certain time such ad 8PM

When the time comes players will be able to join the lobby and ready check. When both players ready checked, champion select will start.

Waiting time is up to 10 minutes. If a player doesn't shoe up or ready check until 8:10, the  other player gets a win.

If both players don't show up, none of them win and the player who would match the winner of them at the next round gets an auto win due to lack of opponent.


**WHO CAN ENTER?**

This is up to Riot. I think everyone should be able to apply expect accounts created after the annoucment of the tournament. Phone verification similar to the Clash's can be used as well.

**EXTRAS**

Special events can be done for the higher rounds, such as broadcasting the games. The grand final can be played at the LCS studios too !

Of course there will be a reward system and a grand prize for the winner


 You can be the king of the server just by playing from your computer and beating 15-20 people. I think this event would be super fun!  Of courde there may be other rules to add or change but I think my system is already very solid. What do you think ?",2019-09-16 16:14:15

In my opinion the amount of lp/mmr you lose/win should be connected to how you performed in the game aswell. I'm not a person qualified for game development so I don't know how hard it would be to implement this, but riot has the system somewhat in place already, tracking a lot of stuff and giving the ranks like C+ or S for performance on your champion, so wouldn't it make more sense if you played well but lost the game, you should lose less than somebody who played poorly and was mainly the reason the team lost the game as you can't control everyone in the game.

Shes a champion that pretty much has been one of the strongest toplaners all season. She finally gets a nerf for once, Her winrate goes from 55% to 48% and then after a week it climbs back to 53 again and once again, she gets nerfed. Now it goes from 53 to 47. And now shes immediately getting a buff, in damage... If you go to [U.GG](https://U.GG) you can already see her winrate is climbing once again. And shes already at 50% in diamond and 53% in masters. Granted in masters its only 390 games, but still.  Why is she even getting a buff?

there are dozens of champions that have a bad winrate and that havent been picked in high elo for months, example is maokai. The guy is literally weak for years now. Why isnt he receiving a buffs or changes. He only gets damage buffs, which he doesnt need. Its utility he needs. But riven is in a good spot. FOR 1 PATCH. and shes getting buffed again. Where does this logic come from. honestly. i know people main her. but this is just unfair for those people who do main champs such as maokai.

&#x200B;

And yes i know Skins have to be a part of this aswell. But isnt this just too obvious? Like people would buy that riven skin regardless of whether shes A tier or S tier. 

For the love of god riot. I cant play this game anymore if all we do is balance around popularity. 

Nerf pyke and kai sa for once. oh wait cant, theyre too popular 

Azir and corki shine for one patch. Insta nerf

Riven is broken for months and people have been begging for nerfs. lets nerf her once. and then buff her again.

I sometimes use this or discord when playing with friends.

* Use or Lose - As soon as voice coms are implemented you have a competitive disadvantage for not using them.

* Languages - The idea of voice coms might seem better in some regions then others. On servers like EUW there is a good chance you won't share a language with your teammates. So if you queue up and you're with people who don't share a language and the other team does you are again RNGed at a advantage or disadvantage. 

* Annoying people - If this is implemented there are gonna be flamers, people blaring music down their mic, terrible patchy mics, and whatever else. Then I have to decide to maybe put up with it or sacrifice communication by muting them.

* Relaxation / Nice environment - It will in my opinion take away a big part of what makes the game relaxing.

I myself am a silver idiot player and was frustrated throughout this season but other than me every friend of mine in every elo level, every streamed I follow in high elo are really not happy with the experience and I am getting the feeling riot doesn't care but nonetheless here are some points I think have to change. Write down your thoughts as well, because it up to us players to repeat and repeat and repeat our feedback, until riot decides to do something about it, cause I love this game and want to enjoy it.

1. THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE!!!! Promotion games HAVE to be gone. After the release of TFT, I realised what makes me mad about this game the most: ppl inting in my promos. And I don't want to ppl who have a bad game but the psychological aspect, that you actually should be in the higher elo because you got 100 LP Soo many times but it's always this 1 game... Ask every psycho Dr. It is built so we all climb WAY slower and play the game longer. It has to stop. Never met anyone who was ok with promos.

2. Second point is also something I REALLY don't understand why riot isn't doing something about it and it's taking reports about INTENTIONALLY feeding players more seriously. Basically you can get banned so much easier if you write the F Word than spaming emotes while running into the enemy AFTER you wrote that you gonna int. They HAVE to be more strict to these ppl and to the ones who go afk after ding once. 

3. This will most likely never change, but pls stop patching based on which skin is coming out and the money you want to make out of it? I know balancing a game like lol isn't easy and overall you are doing an ok job, just what is it with newskin champs getting op all of a sudden AND worst! Why would you patch more for esports than soloQ? I mean I know why but it's just not ok. Specially in lower elo.

It seems that in theory and in practice that it is in no way an intuitive mechanic or benefit to any player. By now, thousands of games have been lost because of a player  getting stuck under a tower with a gang of minions sending the player into a Parkinson attack.

And Riot doesn't hide that creep block is a disadvantage. I believe Alistar and Fizz both had passive that allowed them to move through creeps, as well as PD doing the same. (I'm not entirely sure if that all holds up). 

Getting stuck in minions can't be an actual feature of a multi-million dollar game. Its ridiculous how its still in the game. The PD passive is the equivalent of giving an item the passive that people don't get stuck in walls when you flash over them. 

I may be wrong that creep block doesn't add any inherent value to the game, but I really have never felt that I used the aspect of creep block intuitively in any of my games. Every kill on a creep blocked opponent feels dirty and undeserved.

Overall: Loses feel awful. No control over outcome whatsoever whether its dudes first or second timing champs or getting off roled.

Yes sometimes people on your team are bad, sometimes they have muted all and have gone split pushing on lee jungle with baron up.

It's a team game , there is literally no solution to make all people playing badly go away, if you don't like it, go play StarCraft or something.

It's insane all of this subs posts about there being a serious problem with riots handling of ranked .

What do people actually want riot to do, ban someone on every team that lost because it must have been because of someone trolling . Sorry midlaner you didn't buy any armor vs zed, this is literally inting and you are being perma banned.

Cases of people like buying 6 zeals and going 0/50 are extremely rare , and almost everything else comes down to opinion.

You might be crying about the toplaner splitting and not helping on baron, this is a disagreement on what your team needs to do to win, not inting . Even if he is really stupid and dies 1v5 it still isn't inting, it's just being bad at the game, this shockingly, is allowed.

Even in cases of your teamate mentally checking out and splitting on Janna, how do you actually want riot to detect and punish this that doesn't catch innocent players.

512,Pro Play Champion Diversity Analysis - many classes & subclasses are not being played.,0,d4y888,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/d4y888/pro_play_champion_diversity_analysis_many_classes/,11,1568654779.0,"Hello everyone. Pro play champion diversity is often being complained and I made an analysis. Pro play champion pool is very small because many champion classes and subclasses are never being played at all. Yes, maybe it had been worse in the past but current pro play champion diversity is unacceptable and there are many problems Riot must adress.

Let's analyse what champions types are avaible for each role and how many of them are being played.

Note: We are talking about the general pro play of major regions, please don't come up with one game exceptions like ""But Wunder played Soraka top in a game so enchanters are actually being played"" 

.

**TOP LANE**

3 champion types are usually being played in Top lane.  Tanks ( Ornn, Maokai, Volibear...) , Bruisers ( Irelia, Darius, Renekton..) and Full Offensive ( Tryn, Riven, Yi, Quinn ...)

Out of 3 avaible types, only Bruisers see pro play.  Full tank and and full offensive champions see extremely rare if none pro play. Bruiser pool is very narrow too, out of many bruisers only a few certain champions are being played every game
**1/3**


**JUNGLE**

There are various jungle champions but the main types are  Tanks (Sejuani, J4, Zac...) , Bruisers (Lee, Vi, Hecarim...) , Assasins (Khazix, Rengar, Nocturne...) and Mages (Fiddle, Diana, Ekko...). Out of the four, two of them are being played: Mostly Full Tanks and some Bruisers.

Traditional Jungle Assasins such as the mentioned examples see absolutely zero play. Most of the Jungle Mages see very few to none pro play.
**2/4**


**MID**

Mid lane is interesting, because two traditional mid lane types: Mages and Assasins are not being played at all. Expect Akali who is pretty broken at pro and a bruiserish assasin.

Assasins( Zed, Talon, Katarina, Fizz...) have almost never been picked in the last  couple of years of pro play.  Mages ( Xerath, Velkoz, Malzahar...) see very little pro play aside from some player-spesific picks like Froggen's Anivia.

All do we watch at pro play's midlane nowadays are Irelia, Renekton and Aatrox. These champions were all meant to be played at Top. Current pro play often has 4 Toplane Bruisers for both teams' top+ mid lanes.
**0/2**


**BOTTOM**

There aren't certain subclasses for Marksmans and Marksman champion diversity is healthier than the other roles. But recent matches were almost completely Kaisa vs Xayah and a few alternatives when either is banned, other ADCs like Jhin, Draven, MF and Twitch are pretty much forgotten. Still, Bottom champion diversity is relatively health and all needs to be done is some champion nerf and buffs.


**SUPPORT**

Support subclasses are very well defined and there are 3 of them: Tanks, Mages and Enchanters Out of the three only tanks and Rakan- an off-class champion- are being played at pro.

Tanks( Nautilus, Leona, Alistar...) are pretty much the only type being played at the Support role

Mages( Brand, Zyra, Annie...) are basically nonexistent at pro play pick and ban screen


Enchanters ( Janna, Soraka, Lulu...) were broken at the 2017's Ardent meta but after the nerf to the item their play rate at major regions' pro scene dropped to zero. Currently we don't see any Enchanter at any pro game by any means.
**1/3**

.

**Summary:** When we look at the major regions' general pro play, there are 12 avaible champion types for four roles and only **4/ 12** of them are regularly being played. This is definetly an issue, it cause gamesto be very similar to each other because we watch same matchups like Bruiser vs Bruiser instead of much more interesting and colored matchups between various Mages and Assasins.


Pro play champion diversity is definetly an issue Riot must adress soon. The utopia of every champion being equally played  will never happen but it should be possible to greatly increase the pro play diversity with the correct adjustments to the game.",2019-09-16 13:26:19

Why i say it?

Technically, all Shaco players step by step lose that reason why we chose him for a game, and 3 month ago stop play League and making a content about league, without reasons to play, its just stop being fun, and 3 mounth ago i want to come back, and pick shaco, after few games i 'make a mistake', and repeat it in another game, i was shocked, but it not been me at all, actually mechanic to recall in Q is just disappear, it was unbelievably frustrating. Why is it necessary? For champion it self, that been part of 'FUN' and 'TRICKY' mechanic, i dont find any info in path notes from May to September about it. Support say it's ok now, and it's not a bug.

(I dont ewen tell about how hard Shaco was nerfed in all for a last 4 years)

**So my question:**

Why Shaco mechanic Desive+Recall now instantly reveal Shaco? Can any one say what he think about it, did it make sense?

Is it been really necessary to lose huge part of individuality of champion who must be Fun and Tricky. I feel really frustrated and upset about it, is it step to make mechanically similar champions for all type of players?

but league doesnt love me and neither does riot, is a very abusive relationship, is like the wife that keeps beating you and verbally abusing you for not bringing enough money to the table, you could just leave it and be perfectly fine but you keep coming back, because every non yet played game, is a promise, you dont know what you going to get, you keep promising yourself that are you gonna get better, you try your hardest to achieve it and even frustrate at the teammates who dont share that feeling with you

then sometimes, when you are patient and get good enough, after so many hours of effort, you get a reward, like a dog doing a trick for a snack, except you only get a snack every once in a while, that snack is the next tier in the ladder, like finally reaching gold as a silver player, is just another tier, a number in the screen, an artwork in your profile but in the end, you feel it as more than that, is the tangible truth that you became better at this game, you have longed for this feeling and when it finally happens, you want more 

then you became obsessed with it, drunk from your obsession of having that feeling again, drowning in your own ego, constantly reminding yourself of who you are now and how those days of being bronze are now in the past, you argue with others, you tell them you are better than them and the better you get the more stubborn you become, the less you listen to others and the more you want to be one talking 

then you finally reach diamond, the very bridge between the casual and the pro, you start to wonder how some people even got there? and at some point along the way you begin to wonder if it was really worth it to begin with, you stop being proud of being diamond, because it means being in the same place, being the same that the people that got it and dont deserve it even if you worked hard for it and they didnt, you might even become ashamed of being diamond, you struggle the hardest than any other point in your league career, thoughts start poisoning your mind, *you dont deserve to be diamond*, *you got carried to diamond*, *you are a hardstuck* 

you stop playing as much but still playing not to lose your rank, you begin to watch league more than you play it, you try to find again the fun in it through other's eyes, because you still love the game as much as you did from the very first day but you cant fully get back to it, you find excuses like being busy with school/work, or the meta being a mess, when probably you were even more busy in the past and the meta was worse and you still did manage to find time to play it 

you just dont care about it as much, when in the core you know that you cant get any higher, you somehow have convinced yourself that you are unable to learn a single new thing anymore, you see pro players and find excuses for their climbing, *they are playing broken champions*, *they get carried in duo* but the reality is that you have been limiting yourself because you know that taking the big step means getting out of your comfort zone, because the world has convinced you that change is bad so you dont want change, even if its for the better in the end 

so you become one of the rest, a redditor, with your soul tied to this sub, coming back to it every day even if you already read the whole frontpage, maybe you will find a good comment to farm a lot of karma, taking turns to post the daily *X champion beat me in lane pls nerf* and the *how comes riot still hasnt released X feature* even sometimes jumping on the hate train on whatever is the flavor 

because i love league and you do too

I have been playing league for about 7 years now, and I love it. It is the only game that I constantly play. From time to time I got (from my siblings) a RP card, or invested a little bit from my birthday monney to buy some skins. Over the years I slowly collected some skins, and the skins that I love the most  are the star guardian skins.

3 weeks ago I moved in order to study, right now I am working to get the money  so I can live. Yesterday I finnally had time and thought: I am hard working and I earned it, so Im gonna get the skins.

Than I saw the price. 50€ for 4 skins. I simply cant do that. I expected 20-30€. But 50€ are way too much for me, I would have to cut my meals in order to have enough money for that. FOR 4 SKINS. I remeber the time where a skin was about 900 rp, 1200 at max. Now a standard skin costs 1350. 

Riot I am sad, I love this game and I love the skins, but I am not gonna pay more, cause I cant simply afford it anymore. There is not even an star guardian game mode like it was the last time. Why? I just dont understand it anymore. Its so sad that it just looks like that the only thing they care is money.",2019-09-16 11:31:28

And because i now have to take my now anual break from LoL for the sake of my mental, i'm left with no game to enjoy and that's breaking my heart.

Now let me make this clear, **i'm not hating on LoL (the game) or TFT and i don't want this thread to be a negative one either!**

I've played the damn game for 7 years now so that must count for something, it's just that being unable to play the fancy pants CPU or GPU melting games is super frustrating, so i'm sitting here wondering if there are any other people that are in the same boat as me.

And other than riot recruiting tones of manpower, they claim they can not solve this issue.

i do understand that but let me remind you something riot, most of us, human beings, are bad. we are THAT bad that we make laws and everything to stop people ruining the very society we form. 

Now, you also created a huge society which actually do not enforce and punishment to people who ruin it, that is not acceptable. Yes, there are many challenges such as not wanting to spend huge amount of money for man power, but that is still not a reason to ignore this problem. This act is mandatory.

About the suggestion(all numbers given are example which are stated as bold)

\- Hire freelancer part timers, pay them few amount of money. it might suck for some country citizens whose economy is great, but considering the players base from all over the world, even like **3** usd/h would be perfectly acceptable. Let these people be at least plat. Even if you have 100 people working specifically on this, it would make 3k usd per 10h/day work for 100 people which is nothing for you guys. And **100** people would help a lot.

\- They should only work on ranked games, and punishment is also only ranked game ban. first ban: **1** week, second ban: **2** week, third ban:**1** month, 4th ban forever. riot already handle the account ban part by theirselves.

\- Make a different system for them to watch the games. If there are more than **2** reports on a person, let it be registered as a \`case\` in your tool. Then those cases pile up. Observers just pick the ones starting from the oldest date, and watch them, then chose the punishment or not punish at all

\- Once the system works, even though it doesnt solve all the cases, people will see that there is actually a punishment going on for those kind of people, and the amount of cases will drop a bit. 

\- Give a very specific brief to these observers such as what is punishable and what is not. playing bad and feeding is not punishable, although running down mid is etc...

\- For appeals of cases from the account owners, let riot employees handle the ticket. Not all case owners will submit ticket, dont worry they do know they got punished because they were 1/8 on minute 10 and that was not bad playing. no one is idiot.

\- Pay freelancers via paypal. Easy gg.

\- Make an announcement that people will get punished IF THEY FALSE REPORT TOO. Out of **10** reports, if **5** report is not taken an action, mark them as false reporters which also leads to a ranked game ban.

If a system like this exists, the game quality will rapidly increase.",2019-09-16 09:53:04

542,Was old Aatrox unique in his stat-check nature?,0,d4werl,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/d4werl/was_old_aatrox_unique_in_his_statcheck_nature/,14,1568641264.0,"Almost half the melee fighter champions in the game invariably account for ranged-melee difference by melees having PURELY stat-driven compensations. Darius HP/5 and busted armor value and stupid passive AD (and base AD), Yasuo's crit, Irelia's mixed damage and attack speed, Tryndamere's AD steroids and sustain, Nocturne's AS / AD steroids, Jax's ramping attack speed, Mundo's AD steroid, Trundle's attack speed and AD buff / debuff, Master Yi's AD / true damage / attack speed, Olaf's AS scaling with missing health, Volibear's W, Vi's W etc.

Nothing here indicates that those things by themselves are bad. Most of these are conditional. Same could be said about old Aatrox. Conditional AS based on bloodwell , charged using lane interaction. Someone zones you off and you're weaker, they let you push and you charge it up getting more attack speed, making you stronger. 

Just so we're clear, there is nothing cerebral about a similar lieu of champions doing the exact thing old Aatrox did, hit level 2 and all in with a stat advantage. It just so happens that those arguments only apply to Aatrox, not most of the game's champions. Keep that in mind next time someone drones off about ""stat-check"" while substantiating fuck-all about game design. People give too much credit to Riot's balance philosophy when they're shown to turn on it numerous times and at will. 

My solution would be to not tie reworks and visual updates together. This allows for mistakes and poor decisions to be reverted, unlike Aatrox who is finalized and cannot be reverted. Just take a look at Kog'Maw. His rework was not tied to a visual update and hence the revert made sense since it didn't require them to scrap resources put into art and voice lines and all that stuff.

And just in case someone likes new ""Aatrox"" better, how would it be any different if he was just a new Darkin? Did it really warrant deletion of an old champion? I can argue otherwise, and tackle supposed justifications like easier balancing (which didn't age well considering his current state and the changes he's received thus far) and health for the game (remember reworked Aatrox / Urgot meta?)",2019-09-16 09:41:04
543,"Combining Skin Lines Into One Cohesive World (Featuring Dragon World, Albion, and Elderwood)",3,d4weby,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/d4weby/combining_skin_lines_into_one_cohesive_world/,1,1568641175.0,"**WARNING: THIS IS NOT AT ALL CANON AND IS JUST THE WORK OF A BORED FAN WHO LOVES THE LORE AND HAS TO MUCH TIME ON THEIR HAND. THIS IS A LONG ASS POST.** 

So, anyway, Riot's creative and writing teams have really gone out with the skins, where before they were nothing more than a champion in a costume, now each skin is actually a window to an entire alternate universe. The champions are fully reimagined until a whole other world, and it's brilliant. Of course, because of this, many older skins which didn't really have much meaning to them have suddenly and haphazardly been thrown into these newfound alternate universes. 

I'm here to alleviate this, or quite possibly make it worse, not entirely sure. 

Many skins are often grouped into the same alternate universe due to similar thematics and visuals, such as how Foxfire Ahri is now a part of the Infernal Universe, and Resistance Caitlyn being placed into the Battlecast Universe, and many more examples. While not a, arguably, strong reason, it's strong enough for me. 

That being said, the skin lines Dragon World, Albion, and Elderwood, all have a strong enough resemblance to each other, that seeing them all together in one cohesive alternate universe isn't to farfetched. All are inspired by classical western fantasy tropes, with some Tolkien-esque vibes, and while on a case by case basis aren't all that similar to each other in terms of appearance, when grouped together create one strong diversified alternate universe.  

Side note, for those who have no idea what the Albion skin line is, it's just one of many alternate universes that was created when they started grouping skins together. It's basically just Elf skins, and contains four skins so far, Sherwood Ashe, Nottingham Ezreal, Viridian Kayle, and Blackthorn Morgana.  

The history of each of these alternate universes, while not related to one another, would not destroy or ""break"" the history of the others, and if it were all written together, could create a surprisingly rich background for a new alt. universe.  

For those unaware, let me lay out the history of these alternate universes. 

**DRAGON WORLD** 

Centuries ago, the dragons rose from the land, led by Mordekaiser, hoping to scourge humanity and make himself the ruler of all. He was defeated of course, as all great tyrants are, and since those years, the tales of the dragon crisis have become little more than myth. However, the dragons have risen once more, and now the warriors of the old order of Dragon Slayers must save humanity from utter destruction again.  

**ALBION** 

In a far gone age, there existed an empire, ruled by the Elves, who's magical supremacy crushed all who dared faced them, weaving dark sorceries and other such foul magic. Their empire fell, how is unknown, and now the Elves are split into two distinct groups; the Forest Elves, who live alongside humanity, and the Dark Forest Elves, the last remnants of their once great empire. 

**ELDERWOOD** 

The Elderwood has long been a source of great power, the primal magics that flourish there a tantalizing tool for any would be conqueror. A Coven of witches, led by old gods, sought to take this power for themselves, but were defeated by an order of knights. Centuries have passed since the conflict, but the Fae who call these woods home have never forgotten the scars, and only tolerate humanity. Now, whispers speak of old gods risen once more, the Coven returned to complete the work of their malevolent patrons.   

Due to the limitations of the alternate universes, it's never stated where exactly any of these events took place, only using throw about names that might as well be anywhere. Elderwood only says that the events take place in an ancient forest called the Elderwood, though where this forest actually is, who the fuck knows. Dragon World never actually states any locations, the universe is only called Dragon World due to the fact that Dragons are present. Albion is somewhat of an exception in this regard, outright stating that it takes place in Albion, but if this is a continent, a country, or just a kingdom, is completely unknown.  

Now, let me join all these alternate universes into one cohesive world through some simple world building.  

**THE WORLD** 

The land of Albion had known strife since it's first breath, the lands history carved by the many people and creatures that walk it. 

The Dragons and the Fae were the first beings to roam Albion. The Dragons claimed the mountains, ever flying, ever diligent, yet not without their honor. The Fae claimed the forests, spreading it's verdant growth across the land, caring for their creations with compassion. The land was chaotic, but peaceful none the less, and knew not but harmony. 

The Elves were the second beings to roam Albion. Looking upon the Fae as their kin, the Elves joined them, drinking from a font that laid within the Fae's deepest forest, attuning them to the natural magics of the land. Looking upon the Dragons as their teachers, the Elves learned a respect for power, and the values of leadership and glory. With grace and beauty, they brought order to the land, building wondrous temples and castles that were unrivaled in their majesty. 

Soon, many Elven kingdoms arose, nestled into the countless forests, but the Elves were unlike Fae and Dragons. No matter how long a life they lived, Elves were mortal, death a distant, but unescapable reality. The Elven kings fell to the temptations of greed and pride, and war plagued the land, bringing them close to the edge of utter annihilation. In it's aftermath, a single Elven kingdom, an empire, stood above all. It was during this bloodshed that that the fourth beings to roam Albion had arrived on its shores.

When the Elves ceased their fighting, they had discovered Humanity, the small fledgling tribes of humans fully unaware of the war that had raged right before them. Hoping to teach them much in the same way the Dragons and the Fae had taught them, the Elves took the young Humans under their wings. They watched with horror as they found that humanity only destroyed all that it touched, forests were burned down, animals slaughtered needlessly, their short lives wasted on base pleasures. 

The humans spread as quickly as they corrupted the land, and it wasn't long until they bordered the very first forest, the Elderwood. Fearing what would transpire should the Humans drink from the font as they had, the Elves, relying on their magical supremacy over the humans, conquered them, and all but destroyed them. Under their newfound Elven lords, humanity's growing potential was halted, and they became slaves and little better than servants. 

With the advent of slaves, decadence took root within the Elven Empire, and over the centuries they had grown lazy and prideful, while the human slave rebellions only grew in sheer size and strength. Fearing it's hubris would lead them back down the path of ruin, and this time with no return, a sect of Elves joined and supported the rebelling humans in an effort to save their glorious empire from its own needless devastation. Once more in the land of Albion Elf faced Elf in bitter war, humanity hanging in the balance. 

In the end, the Humans would rise triumph, their freedom theirs, but the Elves, both those that had and hadn't supported humanity, were gifted only with destruction, their magnificent empire toppled, reduced to ruins and rubble.  

Over the following years, the Humans would rebuild that which had been taken from them by the Elves, joining together into one single kingdom, while the Elves faced persecution and violence, even those that had supported humanity. The Human kingdom grew strong and mighty, a golden age for humanity, but conflict would arise once more. 

A man by the name of Mordekaiser rained fire across Albion, followed by dragons he had enthralled through powerful magic. Whether he was a simple human sorcerer hungry for power or an Elf seeking some form of vengeance is unknown, for none had ever seen him without his dreadful armor. He ravaged the world in flame, seeking to rule over all, the Human kingdom was unprepared for such an enemy, and their golden age seemed short lived. 

Their salvation came from an unlikely ally. 

The Elves were not spared in his reign of terror, and rather than share in mutual destruction, they chose to help humanity. Although their power had waned, the Elves still held precious knowledge of powerful rituals and unspeakable sorceries. It was through this knowledge that that Dragon Slayers were born, and with the combined might of these fearsome warriors and Elven mages, Mordekaiser and his dragon army was struck from the sky and buried deep in the earth, where they might never rise again.  

Cementing their alliance with one another over the defeat of their common enemy, many Elves were now seen as heroes, accepted into the human kingdom, some choosing to live right alongside humanity, while others sought to rebuild their own kingdom, coexisting with the humans. Other Elves still clung to the remnants of their fallen empire, hoarding their untold power, and all but disappeared from human sight. A new peaceful era was born, the world finally healing itself after so much pain. 

The Elves built their new kingdoms along the edges of the their beloved forests, and when some humans had attempted to join the Elves in their appreciation of the natural world, a new order was formed. The Knights of The Emerald Chapel deigned themselves the stewards of the Elderwood, and the humans that joined were transformed by magic, no longer human, but something more.

However, it was a coven of human witches that had almost upset the newfound peace.

Worshipping otherworldly patrons known only as the Old Gods, the Coven sought the primal magics of the Elderwood to raise their dark lords. The Fae were attacked at their very source, and recoiled as their birthplace was spoiled by corrupting hands, and the Old Gods were resurrected by their devoted Coven. Just as their shadows began to loom over the Elven and Human kingdoms, they were brought low by the Knights of The Emerald Chapel and a powerful sylvan enchantress. The Old Gods were buried in the Elderwood, their corpses trapped in the roots of the forest they had thought to use, the Coven vanishing into the thin air. 

A century has passed since, the Elven and Human kingdoms are thriving more than ever, but now a new threat emerges from the darkness. The dragons, having fallen into myth and legend to the humans, have risen and taken to the skies, their thunderous shouts sowing terror in Albion. On the edges of the Elve's forest kingdoms, rumor says that the Old Gods have risen from their graves, the Coven reaching out from the shadows.

In just a page of text, I was able to, somewhat, seamlessly blend all three of these alternate universes into one rich world. I was going to give a description of each of the more noteworthy champions that would play an important role in this combined alternate universe, but altogether these skin lines add up to over 20 champions, and I don't think anybody wants to read all that aside from myself. Finally, if I was going to give a name to this combined alternate universe, I'd just call it Albion as all this takes place in the land of Albion. Simple.",2019-09-16 09:39:35

I feel rn he is a bit too strong and oppressive in top lane.  He is one matchup I never enjoyed no matter who I play into him. His damage numbers seem to be a bit too high. I keep the wave frozen in front my turret and even then he has plenty in his kit to harass me through the freeze.  He also can turn a bank into a 1v1. A half decent Mordekaiser honestly just doesn’t let me play the game period. I’m sorry if I’m just complaining here but  I’d like to know if I’m the only one who thinks this and if I’m just complaining for no reason or if it’s actually a problem.,2019-09-16 07:49:21

Match context: We had four people in our squad for a chill normal draft game

Top Poppy
Mid Zed
Our Yuumi Pyke duo

And an autofilled Nocturne jungle

The Pyke had computer issues and was AFK for nearly 12 minutes, bot lane was basically free farming and untouched, our Nocturne autofill was obviously pissed, and after getting himself gangbanged in the river, the dude noped out for the rest of the match.

So I abandoned bot lane and roamed around mid and top, managed to secure 5 kills for the Zed and made sure Nasus could never farm. Our Pyke logged back in just as our Zed's gf called and thus begin the 3v5 landslide of a match. It only took about 10 minutes for me and the Pyke to get full item and myself 25 Mejai stacks. 

With a semi-AP Athene/Ardent build I totalled around 1050 AP towards the end of the match with potion and 1 fire dragon. The enemy team went from soft inting to full tilt, and ran it down Baron at the end, netting the Pyke a quadra kill and secured my S+ MVP.

And it made sense due to how very few exist. unaffected by tenacity and only cleanseable through QSS and certain abilities.

But then i noticed that Displacements are stronger. not just unaffected by tenacity, also uncleanseable by any means.

Which doesn't make sense imo due to the fact that there are as much displacements as Other heavy CCs. yes i even counted it, skip this part if you don't care.

Since then I got really into it and started watching pro, bought some skins, settled into a role (support), and played ranked. I even bought some champs when on sale and I bought the new player pack. I somehow played 856 games and spent 456 hours in the game (according to in client stats) just in 2018 and 2019. I still only have about 2/3 of the champions in the game. I currently don't have 54 of them. This seems rather slow, as I will likely be well over 700 hours before I unlock them all assuming I don't spend blue essence on rune pages or anything else.

Maybe it should take a month worth of in game time to unlock it all, but that seems excessive to me, especially with no solid way to try out unowned champions other than hoping it comes into the free to play batch.

No one on our team became discouraged, and even though we all just met, we were able to make decisions and work together well enough to give their team a decent run for their money (and actually win a few team fights!), as opposed to us just willingly bending over for them, especially against their super-fed Draven.

###The left emote: mad boi

This emote expresses an aggressive kind of impression. Say I’m chasing down a strangled with Rengar. I use the “You’re next” emote to make them shit their pants and send them right to the after life. This emote can also express a kind of small rage, say for example you miss a skill shot and lose a trade in Lansing phase. The Mad Annie emote is a perfect candidate to use in this situation. “Everything is fine” Soraka works too! It shows that you’re joking about being mad, but in truth you’re actually mad.

###The top emote: fuck boi

This emote is used when you DO win a trade during laning phase. Say you do a successful trade with Irelia. You jab the opposing Syndra with your dancing blades and dash right out of her skill shots. You land your Vanguards Edge and win the fight! While using the Joestars secret technique, use a rather smug emote, such as Lulus Laugh or any of the Ezreal emotes cause Ezreal is literally the personification of Fuckboi. Often, this emote works tangent with a “?” in all chat. Note that this is high risk high reward because a returning “?” after your own death could tilt yourself.

###The right emote: support boi

With all this playing with emotions and manipulating the enemy champion stuff, let’s take a more positive route with the positive emote! This emote is primarily used for support mains but is totally fine with any other lane. The emote is used if you’re feeling in a good mood or trying to call someone down; using an emote like “Bee Happy” or  “Poro Pal” will reduce the chances of your crybaby ADC of accidentally on purpose dc’ing after dying twice. It just boosts the morale of your own team, and it can even make someone feel bad for bullying you in all chat. Note that this emote works very well with “uwu” and “owo” faces, as cringe as it is. Note that your ADC might think you’re a total fucking weeb and goes top lane cause they’d rather lane with a depressed Ornn main than an Otaku.

###The bottom emote: reward boi

Of course, you want to show off your honor level 5; who doesn’t? This emote is dedicated to showing off these fabulous rewards like the “Legend” emote line, showing off how much time you wasted on the game. The ranked split season awards work to, such as the “Ranked Morgana” and recently “Ranked Qiyana” emote. Only downside to this emote is that you must be in a rather high Elo in order to flaunt your ranked emote; anti social bullies will sometimes beat you up for your silver Morgana emote, hence making this the most situational emote to use.

###The middle emote: thumbs up boi

There are over 100 emotes in LoL (I think), but the thumbs up is the most iconic and basic emote. It works well in almost all situations, all stages of the game, and it’s free!

1) Make it so anyone dashing into the ability is stunned upon arrival with ult hitbox

2) Make the vines act as a physical unit-- ie. if Sion ults into Maokai ult he will stop upon colliding with Maokai Ult (Sion ultimate is unstoppable so wouldn't be stunned but he would be stopped).

**14th: (0-6) Dark passage 2014 Worlds:** bad start for turkey, (It’ll keep getting worse for them) going 0-6, vs pretty average teams too like ahq and edg, they were faced with worlds champions though.

**13th: (0-6) Bangkok Titans 2015 Worlds:** The 1st SEA team, only above DP due to the fact it was 2015, which was an awful meta and had to face edg and skt, quite formidable opponents, skt and this edg were far better than the edg at worlds 2014 and ssw though.

**12th:  (0-5) Beşiktaş Esports 2015 MSI:** Turkey’s 2nd event, and they’re back as bad as ever and again poor performances all around, the MSI format was new and was only 5 games so they get a bigger pass than them before it.

**11th: (0-6) 1907 Fenerbahçe 2017 Worlds:** Wow, You got the worst team from a main 5 region ever (Thanks LMS!). Unfortunately for you, lady luck hates you, you got seeded into RNG and Samsung, the Unexpected winners of worlds and the most favored chinese team, especially thanks to the meta at the time.

**10th: (1-9) SuperMassive eSports 2016 MSI:** they had a lot of spunk and cool picks, Dumbledoge’s bard to upset clg, the 2016 msi runners up was one of them.But other than the upset they were the typical Turkish Wildcard, bad.

**9th: (1-5) INTZ e-Sports 2016 Worlds:** this is where we get to “oh they did that thing” territory where they legitimately changed how the Worlds/MSI group stage went, Yet this had some of the least impact of worlds, they, on Day 1 of worlds, beat EDG which was probably an extreme tilter for EDG, especially with that loss giving H2K the possibility to tie with EDG then H2K winning that, yet this win can’t go over the fact they weren’t that good, But they’re middle of the pact in terms of WC teams, just like most brazilian teams.

**8th: (2-8) PVB 2019 MSI:** I’m a huge vietnam fan but this squad was the most underwhelming of all the vietnamese teams, other than memily beating G2, MSI champs both times, their other games were relatively poor, Especially when they went 0-5 vs NA,the 1st vietnamese team to not win 1 game vs NA

**7th: (1-5) Kabuum e-Sports 2014 Worlds:** “Why Kabuum over PVB (2019) and INTZ?” you may ask, well other than the fact how impacting their 1 win was, it not only locked c9 for at least a tiebreaker at worst and make playoffs with a chance to get 1st seed at best; But also paved the way for wildcard teams not to be seen as ape monkeys (unless ur a turkish wildcard), Not to mention how much HARDER their group was than anyone before it, Alliance, who beat fnatic, the 1st time fnatic didn’t win, C9 under Hai in their prime, and Najin White Shield. The fact they managed to win 1 is quite amazing. They truly did change the tides of history.

**6th: (2-8) EVOS esports 2018 MSI:** This team was pretty average, they were the 2nd best MSI team, they weren’t that memorable really, they took a game off eu and na each respectively, which didn’t have any impact other than making them both seem like negative w/r monkies (4-6) who played a tiebreaker just to lose (fnatic won and got 3-0’d by RNG) they had some decent games where they still lost. Really nothing to say about them really.

**5th: (2-4) paiN Gaming 2015 Worlds:** The best Brazilian result in the history of INT. events, while they didn’t make history like Kabuum did they were the first WC team to win 2 games, which is pretty impressive in itself, their group wasn’t that hard but it has challengers like flash wolves, which them and AHQ were the best LMS teams in a while, and there hasn’t been on their level in the LMS for a while. And Koo tigers, they also helped make NA want to die with their 0-10 week 2, and humiliated CLG by beating them, so much that Zionspartan changed his name to darshan and Pobelter and Doublelift left the team. Good team overall.

**4th: (2-4) Phong Vũ Buffalo 2018 Worlds:** Thanks to Evos, they were the only WC team to make worlds, due to being put directly into groups. I consider this team in a way, Kabuum on steroids. Thanks to them G2 didn’t meet certain doom if they lost to Afeeca (which they did), people forget this but if Mr.Buffalo didn’t beat Flash wolves, g2 wouldn’t have never made playoffs, and g2 would’ve never beat rng and we wouldn’t have all the good memes about the smug Croatians; oh yeah PVB also beat g2. That happened. Either way G2 was surely saying “TY Mr.Buffalo.”

**3rd: (3-7) Gigabyte Marines 2017 MSI:** This team was a blessed thing that not alot of people appreciate. Their way of playing games, their style, their moves. This team was a blast to watch and they were good too! I don’t talk about play-ins cuz they don’t count but they almost 3-0’d TSM yet couldn’t finish them off when they needed to which caused a reverse sweep to happen, they have the highest record at MSI for any wildcard team at 3-7 even beating team WE, and everyone loved this team to bits. The roster was impeccable and one of the best ones. GAM caused the VCS to be their own region, and be looked at with such a dominance that could possibly overshadow the LMS very soon. They started the vietnamese renaissance. GAM will always be looked at as an exciting team and loved by all.

**2nd: (2-4) Gigabyte Marines 2017 Worlds:** Everything I said, but The roster is different, due to how good GAM looked there was most likely contracts flying in the VCS (which was under the GPL at the time) most of the rooster is gone, Their support is their top laner, which caused their bottom half of the map to be different, Yet With popular vietnamese players such as Noway and Optimus, and their all-star jungler Levi, they had a great chance, to actually make it out of groups, and they almost did, they beat immortals and fnatic both once, and almost being Longzhu gaming, favorites of worlds, only losing due to LZ scaling up. causing a 3 way tie with them being 1st seeded in the mini-tie breaker tournament, unfortunately they did lose, but that didn’t stop them from being beloved by all, even in what’s considered one of the worst metas, ardent meta, they shined with their amazing playstyles, god bless GAM for making me a fan of vietnam so much and lets hope they do stellar at 2019 worlds. If they made playoffs they’d be definitely number 1, yet they didn’t so...



**1st: (4-2, 2nd place in Group A, Worlds Quarter Finalist, Albus Nox Luna 2016 Worlds)** 

Everyone probably saw this coming, this team was truly a great moment in LoL history, this team was insane, going 4-2 in a group where no one expected them to get past 1 win. This team did it all, 1st team to make playoffs, 1st team to beat a korean team, 1st team to 2-0 a main 5 team, they had the most upsets, they amazed everyone, it was shocking in every way possible. Their Playstyle was exciting, bringing out brand support, which was a shocking pick at the time only being done once in 2015 worlds, yet they won with it in this one unlike 2015, their support was proficient at it too, play it in the IWC too. They beat g2 and rox, worlds favorite, both once and went 2-0 vs clg, they forced a tie breaker vs ROX, which they unfortunately lost. And then lost to h2k. Yet let this defeat not sour the thought of them as they proved just because you’re a wild card doesn’t mean you’re a loser by default, they were the nail in the coffin which caused play-ins to start being a thing, Kabum, and PaiN may have done amazing things for wildcards, but nothing will beat the amazement of ANX, The only CIS team to even make the main event God bless you ANX.",2019-09-16 03:35:02

The Dade award is named after Dade (one of the greatest mid players of all time) after his team, Samsung Ozone, had a terrible worlds run in 2013 and Dade played badly. The award, as defined by Montecristo, is given to a player who is good and had high expectations going into Worlds but failed to live up to the hype during Worlds. Dade did go on to be the best mid of 2014 however as well as being the captain of the best team of 2014, SSB. Unfortunately for him, after countless of nerfs to SSB’s meta defining play style, SSW were better during Worlds 2014. 

Thus far the winners are;

2013: Dade


2014: NaMei (adc of EDG, was the best adc in China and ppl saw EDG as a contender for the title. Unfortunately the team fell ill)

2015: We1less (mid of LGD and 2nd best mid in the LPL after Rookie. Insane player and people couldn’t decide on whether SKT or LGD would win. Imp who was their adc likely had the greatest season an adc has ever had (being the first player to get a LoL triple crown) and was ranked ahead of Faker as the best player in the World. After a terrible week 1 LGD unfortunately couldn’t get to groups with their sub top laner, Flame, during week 2, where they played a lot better).

2016: EDG ClearLove

2017: Hardest season to give the award for but common consensus is TSM Bjergsen.

2018: RNG Uzi (some ppl will say it was “the entirety of GENG” but they can safely be ignored as no one expected anything from GENG and GENG weren’t hyped)",2019-09-16 03:21:25

Perennial international performer with a jungler whose name can be in the conversation for one of the most exciting to watch at worlds, and a hotboi in the bot lane that is average at best regionally but always steps the fuck up when he crosses the pond. - Cloud 9

:/ means I would rather not.

:) means I'd 10/10 hug!

&#x200B;

This post is mostly for fun, but there are some champions that definitely need a hug that I'd totally give one to. We all go through hard times, and many of the League's champions are going through the crisis of their life, or need to repair themselves up a bit.

I've categorized them into lists depending on how lethal it would be to hug one, and how much I'd want to give them a hug.

&#x200B;

Champions that seem like the need a hug, but would probably end up killing you if you do so:

(This includes indirect methods of death not caused directly by the hugging)

&#x200B;

Amumu. He really does need a hug, but touching him would instantly kill you. I wonder if there's a hextech contraption that can give him a hug that way? Poor boy :\*(

Aatrox. He seems like he'd be angry at you, and try to kill you, but if you did get past his hateful exterior, who knows? He might just be suffering a lot. :(

Anivia. Unless you were frostborn, her True Ice body would kill you fairly quickly. :/

Aurelion Sol. Too proud. Would instantly smite in starfire. :/

Brand. Oof ouch hot :/

Cho'Gath. He wouldn't kill you by eating you, but rather by accidentally stomping you before he gets the chance to eat you. :/

Darius. He'd probably think you were an Assassin. A way to avoid death is if you made it not worth his energy to kill you, but that's extremely difficult. :/

Dr Mundo. He'd probably crush you in his arms. :/

Elise. She'd eat you. :/

Fiddlesticks. :/

Gangplank. You'd die of the 26+ STDs he likely has thanks to the massive amount of pubic hair on his chest. :/

Hecarim. Would instantly kill you by stomping / slicing. :/

Karthus. Would kill you in an attempt to invite you to undeath. He does it on purpose for a reason other than hate though, so that's a first. :/

Kha'Zix. Unless you have no redeemable features, he'd kill you and evolve. :/

Kindred. Only because if you're seeing them, they're here to kill you anyway. Hugging Lamb or Wolf wouldn't be how you died, but if you wanted to hug them you'd end up dying. I recommend Lamb's arrow btw. :/

Kled. Too territorial, and probably high on ""mushroom juice"" anyway. :/

Kog'maw. Would be too hungry to resist eating you. Seems like it's genuinely not evil though :(

Lissandra. Brr \*chatter\* so cold... :/

Malzahar. Wants the world to end so everyone dies. :/

Mordekaiser. Would consider it a blessing for you to kill you. :/

Morgana. Just kidding. YOU THOUGHT MY MAGIC EVIL! (She doesn't belong here)

Nocturne. Literal Darkness with scythe hands. :/

Qiyana. No one is worthy to touch her apparently. :/

Rek'sai. Just like Kog'maw, but mean. :/

Singed. Wouldn't kill you directly through hugging, but would definetly experiment on you. :/

Swain. Would use your soul to power himself up. :/

Syndra. Poor girl. Probably needs someone to listen to her above all else. Would probably kill you out of distrust. :(

Tahm Kench. Would eat you. Making a deal with him would prolong your lifespan, and if you manage to die before he collects his debt you may avoid death by his hands, but I'm considering this a death sentence. :/

Thresh. Would collect your soul. He'd torture you for eternity, so unless you're REALLY into BDSM or you're a super plus ultra masochist, I'd avoid. :/

Trundle. Would bash your head in. :/

Twitch. Would kill you with an arrow + filthy diseases + the STDs Gangplank had. :/

Urgot. SHOTGUN KNEES :/

Vel'Koz. Would attempt to gain information and disintegrate you. Perhaps he'd learn about emotions though. :/

Xerath. Would annihilate you by magic. :/

Zed. Would probably attempt to kill you just because he's an angery boi, but if you managed to convince him you were just someone who'd listen to him, he might end up crying in your shoulder. :(

Zyra. Would kill you and use your body as plant food. :/

&#x200B;

Champions that have high potential to kill you, but have clear ways to avoid death:

Annie? She might accidentally roast you with a totally sick burn, and I guess also fire magic, but if you give her short hugs, it's likely that the magic won't have time to build up, making this a pretty safe option. Poor girl needs a hug after her entire family died. :(

Evelynn? She might kill you instantly, but if you preform the act free of lust, she won't bother killing you. ;)

Kalista? She might be sent after you to kill you, in which case you're dead, but if you manage to avoid angering anyone, you might be able to hug her. However, you'll also have to survive The Harrowing, which is scary.

LeBlanc? Either you're hugging someone LeBlanc is disguised as, or you're already in her chamber and she's ready to kill you at any instance. Simple solution? Join the Black Rose. :/

Galio? If he's alive, he'd belong in the Accidental Crushing category, but the easy way to avoid dying is to simply hug him while he's solid. :( Poor Galio.

Pyke? He'd try to kill you unless you proved your name wasn't actually on the list. I feel like he's a victim of circumstance that's being controlled in part by that massive fish thing. I hope you find peace Pyke :(

Renekton? If he is in an enraged period, he'll kill you. However, if you approach him while he's in a relatively calm state of mind, and attempt to reason with him, if your name isn't Nasus you'll actually probably be fine. :( Poor boi being lied to by Xerath. :(

Rengar? Would probably TRY to kill you. You could either give him more information about Kha'zix, making him see you as an ally, or you could bring some cat toys with you, making him see you as an ally. :/

Skarner? Might accidentally pince you to death. Would also kill you if you were Jayce. Otherwise, he seems really lonely and sad about his race being slaughtered. Just ask him to keep his pincers closed and his stinger far away from your face, :(

Teemo? CUDDLY BOI IS SURROUNDED BY TOXIC SHROOMS. DO NOT APPROACH UNLESS YOU HAVE AN ORACLE LENS. Remember, Oracle Lens are FREE, and you can get them whenever you want. :)

Veigar? Might try to kill you with magic. Just pretend you're praising him for being so evil, and submitting to his power, when in reality you're just trying to nuzzle his cute and fuzzy lil' face :)

Warwick? Don't get blood on yourself. He might be really happy at the company. Also be careful not to get cut on his claws or he'll eat you. :/

Xayah? Would probably cut you up, unless you're fighting for her, and hugged her suddenly at a victory of some sort. Then she might spare you.

&#x200B;

Accidental Crushing category: High risk of death simply due to being accidentally crushed by the participating party.

Alistar: Big hooves mean big stomps. :/

Illaoi: Unlike most, you wouldn't be crushed underneath her. Her hug would crush you. :(

Malphite: A literal mountain :/

Maokai: Massive tree might crush you with his unsteady arm. I am sad about the loss of his paradise home though :(

Nautilus: Nautilus is MASSIVE. He'd probably crush you in an instant. :/

Sejuani: Goes here instead of ""likely will kill you"" as Bristle would probably accidentally run you over before she even saw you. :/

Sion: Would probably accidentally run over you during his choo choo train. :/

Vi: Ms. Fathands. :/

Volibear: Would probably accidentally kill you due to his size, lightning, or whatnot. :/

\*Although if Papaya-Dreaming is to be trusted, his paw is small enough to gently stomp Teemo, and can be careful enough to gently roll the breath out of his lungs. I'll post the link in the comments if I can figure out how Reddit works.

&#x200B;

Champions that may or may not kill you, as there isn't enough information on their properties:

Bard: The only way this floofball would kill you is by accident simply as a byproduct of massive amounts of energy. I don't think that he would allow you to hug him if that were the case though. :)

Cassiopeia? Unknown if she would try to kill you, or would feel grateful that you treat her like a human. :/

Diana? Don't know enough about her at all. She's like that neighborhood child that would always walk out at midnight, scream ""I'm allergic to the sun!"" and then walk back into her house. I only know her name because her parents yelled at her. :/

Draven? Would he adore the attention or feel angry for you knocking that single hair out of place? No one knows. Also please Riot remove his ugly ass rat ponytail :/

Kayle? May attempt to cleanse you of sin by killing you. No one is perfect, and everyone has ""sinned"" at some point, except for maybe some prophets / incarnations depending on your religion, if you have one. However, she might also just be hurting on the inside, wanting reconciliation with her sister, and to find who she really is. This is a really hard decision, as I don't know if I'd want to hug her or not, but I'd like to give her some comfort at least. :(

Jhin: He might kill you to turn you into art, but he might also consider you ""unworthy"" of being part of his art, in which case he'd probably shove you aside instead of wasting a bullet on you. :/

Jinx? May blow you up, may hug you harder than you hug her, may just laugh and run away. Who knows. :/

Shaco? It's completely unknown if he would kill you or not. He might just laugh. :/

Varus? It's unknown how much total control the human counterparts have over the body at any given moment. Poor guys inside need some support though. :(

Vladimir? It's unknown if he'd truly want to kill you, although it's highly likely. However, if he's playing the part of a socialite, then he probably won't blow his cover. He also might enjoy playing the part of an ordinary average person. :/

These are the questionable cuddles. I might make a list of champions that I'd hug without having to risk my life later.",2019-09-16 02:59:56

And let me tell you guys - I am sick of banning Yasuo & Kha'Zix for 3 years straight and begging teammates to ban the other each and every single game. I genuinely think Yasuo is unfun champion to mess around with.

For me it usually comes down to Yasuo's being too unkillble throughout the game. You can't touch his Q's and E dashes since this is the core of the champion but I think I figures a perfect solution that would balance this idiot monstrosity called Yasuo,
And it is incredibly simple: **Make his Wind Wall work like Pantheon's E.**

That why you get a change to outplay if u move behind his wall + he can bait you there for plays with teammates.

I honestly believe this wound his toxicity way down and make the experience of playing skirmishes vs this impossible champion.

Not so long ago role queue didn't exist. Learn the game as a whole, and play your best no matter where you go. Your skillset isn't exclusive to position. 

Good players are good players because they know:

Macro (jungle) 

Lane trading (mid)

Wave Control (top)

Teamfight positioning (adc)

Vision control (support)

You should work towards improving all of those skills, because every role needs them. Some just more than others.

and when you get better, BECAUSE you know all of the core concepts, you play any role.

you can always be better",2019-09-16 02:42:16

Solo que should be an expression of individual skill and how individuals work as a team. Having a duo partner ruins this experience because they usually focus on each other in most cases and have an advantage over a single player in laning phase. This isn’t fun for the person laning against them and also not fun for the rest of their own team who are being ignored. This would also get rid of the type of boosting where players get a smurf partner to carry them and make them seem like they’re good players statistically.,2019-09-16 02:35:25

I can not lane against new champs with Ahri and that's my main ofc but it just irritates the crap out of me. It is beginning to feel like I have to spend money to get these new champs since it takes decades to earn RP or whatever the heck they changed it to. 

&#x200B;

I can be building correctly and still a full combo won't kill the enemy... Why did they turn my girl into trash??? Now I can barely lane against champs like Zoe and Neeko. It is ridiculous... 

&#x200B;

Sure I'm salty but I'm sure other people agree. And the rune pages make it even worse. Why even have all these pages that we can't even edit? and why do I have to pay MONEY TO GET MORE? 

&#x200B;

And I don't understand why they can't find a way to balance the game so everyone can play any champ and rely more on builds and runes than their stupid kit or op start power. And meta shouldn't really be a thing should it? It's kind of stupid tbh... Because you know who is top 1,2 tier???? NEW CHAMPS. That returning players can't afford cause they didn't save up or have the money to buy. Then it takes weeks to even get that champion so you have to deal with getting your ass handed to you until you can afford a now meta champ? That may end up being changed by the time you get to it. I'm just so tired of it. I really like the game and I want to enjoy it but all my champs are no longer meta. It's ridiculous.

Not sure how it even got approved, the difference between first and second place is basically non-existent, while the difference between placing second and third is astronomical. Getting second place means you can lose one and win one to be in the finals for a second shot against the team you just lost to. While if you're in third place you have to win three straight Bo5 to get to the finals with no room for any losses.

Worth mentioning is also that the finalist have no time to completely dedicate towards each other, since they have to play a day after the second finalist team is decided. Second shots in a play-off format has also always seemed silly to me.",2019-09-16 02:00:53

There are 3 spots you can be ganked from: Lane (sitting in the bushes), River, and Tribush, but we only get 1 trinket that lasts for 90 seconds and recharges after 240. If you are ahead you can also get a control ward, but still,in the best scenario you can ward 2 of the 3 possible spots for only 90 seconds.
And on top of that, the lane is 2km long, so if you are slightly overextended (unless you have a deep ward, which forces you to lose xps) you won't be able to escape even if you see him.

But lets say that you took your time and lost xp to get that nice deep ward, it would be a shame if somone used a blast cone to ignore it right? Yea thats pretty much top lane.

Now, some might say that bot lane and top lane are shaped in the same way, but in bot lane there are 2 people who can ward",2019-09-16 01:03:10

Given the amount of pitchforking around Riot's business practices, I think we should take a step back and re-examine three points *not* in that space. 

These three points are the League Partner Program, the report system, and voice comms for solo queue. I will weave between them to better make points.

Let's start with the report system.

First: *The in-game report system is completely automated.* I am unsure why this is ever questioned by the community - it is verifiable [here](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/reports-how-do-they-work).

This in and of itself is an issue because the system is clearly not serving its intended purpose. The system is able to pick up on excessive use of foul (text) language, specific hateful phrases, etc. but nothing gameplay related - which is, by and large, the bigger and more egregious issue per the community. 

[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/9lmg47/inting_sion_is_doing_more_harm_than_good/e790zkq/) is very telling about Riot's stance on the matter. Maple's wording, especially ""incorrectly banned"" and ""isn't something that *should* be punished"" would indicate to me that no one in involved in policing solo queue playing activity. They seem to be rather indifferent on what is considered acceptable playing standards, and in no way have reported potential changes to the punishment system aside from automated chat moderation, and potentially a **VERY** blatant pattern of intentionally feeding, ie buying bad items, 0-XX scorelines, etc.

There is no way to automate such activity correctly. The only real solution is human engagement - internal or community-driven. I would understand Riot's reluctance to implement something internally, as the costs would be enormous, but can't see a reason not to pass it to the community, who would happily work to clean up their games.

Which brings me to voice chat.

It isn't going to happen, for the same reasons as above - what would be spoken over comms cannot utilize the same automated punishment system in the same way text chat is policed, which is a sad reality and leads into a discussion on target audience, Riot's stance on online communication, and branding. Why would they not want to go this route when *every other major online competitive game serves this feature as a staple*? I was glad when a large figurehead (Tyler1) began to push for this vehemently during Season 8, but then mysteriously got quiet on the subject. Right around the time of the introduction of the League Partner Program.

The failure of the League Partner Program was on both sides, and may be the most unprofessional relationship between a major company and community leaders I've ever seen. When *multiple* community leaders that you, Riot Games, endorse through a partnership program, constantly refer to you as a ""dogshit company"", that speaks volumes for your practices and treatment of that very community. This should be a massive wake up call for not just Riot, but the industry at large. Streamers do not treat Riot with any respect, because of not listening to their gripes/troubles with how the state of the game is being handled, and in turn Riot no longer wants to pursue that relationship or cater to it in any way. And that is a shame, particularly because it will be increasingly difficult for Riot to draw new brand leaders in if anyone externally views how their peers are being treated currently.

Which brings me to my final point - Riot's next IP will fail. Miserably, and by their own fault. Their neglect for the community will be their downfall, and neglect for the game that put them where they are today will be the nail in the coffin. League of Legends is an **incredible** game, which, despite its flaws, is why we still play it - and perhaps that's good enough for Riot while they place their eggs elsewhere.

If anything, I think all anyone can want at present is a statement from Riot presenting their Strategic vision for League of Legends - because at this rate, we won't see a 20 year anniversary.

TL;DR: Report system doesn't work for all behavior that drives people away from the game, voice comms will never be implemented , League Partner Program ruined any sort of future outreach opportunities for League of Legends and damaged potential for new IPs.",2019-09-16 00:04:38

I have played League Of Legends since season 3 and I am an esports enthusiast.

&#x200B;

[Final LLA Spring Split 2019 R7 vs ISG](https://i.redd.it/8l8lu177atm31.jpg)

Liga Latinoamerica 2019

Given the affection that I have for the competitive scene of LoL in Latin America and that the return of its maximum competition circuit to Mexico was recently announced, I am encouraged to make this publication.

As we all know, with the announcement of moving the league back to Mexico, the entire competitive scene will revolve around the capital of the country. The decision brings very good news for players, organizations, middle people and fans, who see with promising eyes next year.

Personally, I consider it a success for the league to return to the capital of Mexico, but there are many aspects that are being neglected, that are not turning to see and when the time comes, they will be crucial to make informed decisions about the League Latin America of League Of Legends.

**Background**

By the end of 2018, the budget cut for investment in esports by Riot Games is announced globally, with the emerging regions being the most affected.

&#x200B;

[Lyon Gaming vs Just Toys Havoks \/ Final LLN Opening 2017 - Pavilion M, Monterrey](https://i.redd.it/ybm5kqzratm31.jpg)

Lacking a true initiative to create a long-term self-sustaining ecosystem, the North and South Latin American leagues had no choice but to comply with the order given to them, closing one of the two existing leagues.

That same year the transfer of the entire scene to Santiago de Chile is announced, creating in the whole community a huge disagreement and outrage on the part of all the people involved with the competitive: players, technical staff, owners, storytellers and production team, they found from one moment to another without employment, not only people from the north office but also in the south.

The esports team for LATAM only created momentary gains, where brands that granted resources to the league would end up losing their investment. On the other hand, such decisions are plagued by rumors, alleged acts of corruption developed by the Riot Games staff of the Local offices.

**League development during 2019**

The start date of the new league attracted a lot of curious people interested in the work that was being done for this new league.

Once again the division of Riot Games focused on esports did not arrive without controversy for the start-up, since the organizations selected to have a quota within the LLA were not consistent with the selection guidelines they said to consider to choose the teams, supposed best organizations, the focus of the storm being the selection of the All Knights team to enter, who left out other teams with more fan base and history.

This situation deserves its own entrance.

&#x200B;

[New Logo and Name LLA](https://i.redd.it/legkp9w4btm31.jpg)

One of the anchors used by the esports team, to justify the movement of the league to Chile, was a sponsorship agreement with the telecommunications company Movistar, being such a sponsorship that occupied a space within the name of the league being now “Liga Movistar Latin America”.

More arguments without meaning or coherence were given during the march to justify a clearly unilateral business decision that did not take care of anyone's interests other than the Riot Games Latam office, thus forgetting the values ​​that one day built the company.

Since the league was in development, all the staff responsible for the realization of the live broadcast was widely questioned, the audience considered that the times to start the games were too long, the breaks between games were excessive, the colors and general design were nasty in sight. All this without considering a poor and poorly planned league format, which did not catch the audience.

Some of these shortcomings are the following:

1. The super weeks; weekends where games were broadcast throughout the day, the days were seen by very few people since it involved being too many hours watching the broadcast (You want to do more things on the weekend, right?), it was better to just watch the results at the end of the day.
2. Bad alignment of narrators, for the vast majority of the audience, the alignment that was selected for this new cycle of the project, was very poor, the people of the north did not feel represented within the transmission, and that is, having eliminated to Skyshock and Nosfeh of the panorama (Main narrators of the region) and other characters like XavyBecker, the audience no longer had the main characters for whom they saw the competitive LoL.
3. The format of the league allowed teams that added only 40% of the possible points to win, had the possibility of entering the qualifiers, this implies a low competitive level and poor spectacle within the games, which they felt without emotion, history or without substance
4. The final of the spring split… Well, for those who saw it, I think there is not much to say ... for those who did not see it, it was a clearly badly planned event, with a show grating in bad taste and a clear sign of incompetence in what to plan events refer.

*Processing img y2ipg0clbtm31...*

Considering what has been described so far, by the time the biggest mid-year tournament at the global level arrived (The Mid Season Invitational), it was more than obvious that there was no long-term plan and they were just improvising on the fly.

The results for the representation of the LLA (Isurus Gaming) in the MSI were evidence of the bad work that is being done in the region to increase the competitive level of our children and therefore in the number of people following the scene.

[ Isurus result in the MSI](https://i.redd.it/j97fqp8sbtm31.png)

For the second split, the situation did not change too much, at least I did not realize it since I was busy with other issues, until the final came, as for the first half of the year the best team in the league was Isurus Gaming, and the opponent to complete the process was All Knigths.

The event was held in a city that is practically unknown even to the same Chilean citizens (or so it seems at least), in an old and dilapidated enclosure, where it seems that the owner of the place paid them to perform there.

I do not know exactly how rumors began that the league was in talks to return to Mexico, this of course by the hand of a deal for a significant amount of money, which would be used for the establishment of the league in Mexico.

The offer could not come at a better time for the Riot Games Latam office, the movement to Chile had been a complete failure and an offer like this would allow them to shake off the debris of their bad planning.

**Joy**

For many, it may not be well known, but Mexico is one of the main consumers in the field of video games, being the number 1 in Latin America, and 12 worldwide, a market with revenues of 1.6 billion dollars in 2018 alone. Having a panorama of such abundance, making the decision to transfer the LLA to Mexico seems the most correct, if what is sought is to grow the competitive system of League Of Legends.

[Lyon Gaming vs Just Toys Havoks \/ Final LLN Opening 2017 - Pavilion M, Monterrey](https://i.redd.it/l09j3115ctm31.jpg)

For the organizations, it means being able to have practice sessions with teams from the United States and Canada, very well trained teams that make the experience of facing opponents that are later in the esports culture available to teams in this region.

For the players and technical staff, several of them will be happy to return to Mexico, meet again with friends, return to play professionally and undertake new projects.

For private initiatives they are good news too, having the LLA implies an infinite amount of possibilities to generate content, projects and businesses around the scene.

&#x200B;

[Lyon Gaming vs Just Toys Havoks \/ Final LLN Opening 2017 - Pavilion M, Monterrey](https://i.redd.it/ybfia6victm31.jpg)

**The disaster they left**

Of course, making such a large movement has its consequences, and the damages left to the passage of the LLA through Chile are several.

When deciding to move esports to Chile and concentrate the content and community team in Mexico, he made his players feel abandoned, those from the north because they saw that their league was eliminated and in the south because community activities were greatly reduced.

The organizations of the South, teams that were constituted in countries like Chile or Argentina will have to face the decision to abandon their life in the South to continue their professional career.

The sponsors were once again used and discarded upon arrival a better offer.

Movistar will remain in the south possibly without having generated everything he expected from the deal with Riot Games Latam, it will be the same situation for many other smaller sponsors, understand that the lack of stability in a project causes losses for people involved, leaving them in debt and in very precarious situations, benefiting only a few.

This issue is possibly one of the main factors to consider for the lag in esports that South America will suffer.

[Final League Movistar Latin America League of legends at Movistar Arena](https://i.redd.it/9ywgy5fvctm31.jpg)

**Conclusions**

Having the LLA back in Mexico is loaded with long-term blessings, the opportunities to grow the esports scene in the region are enormous, drawing on the maturity of the people who have raised the scene, they can structure good ideas into projects viable, such as the new pay channel launched by our favorite television station in Mexico, Televisa.

There are questions that have yet to be resolved, such as, for example, what is going to happen with the Professional Videogames League and national circuits ?, which is clearly a big problem for the generation of new talent in the region.

Both the community and the competitive scene of LoL in Latin America South will be relegated to a plane very close to oblivion, depending on how the situation is handled in coming years, it could well mean the total abandonment of the community and with this, its income, leading to the eventual closing of the offices in the South.

The bet that Azteca Deportes and Cinemex is making, although it might seem great, it is not, 5 million dollars is a fairly modest investment for companies of those sizes, the problem is that they have no real information of what they have just acquired.

Proof of this is how they want to implant in an unorganic way their most decrepit and mundane contents such as Mrs. Laura Bozzo, taking time within the contents of the league, this only demonstrates their lack of understanding of esports.

https://i.redd.it/6lwmmhv7dtm31.png

I am concerned about the degree of ignorance with which they are addressing this project, statements by Raúl Fernández (General Manager of Riot Games Latam), a 3-year agreement was signed, in which the esports team will have the opportunity to correct the direction they have taken, although they have not shown any intention of it.

If this trend continues, the future of this project will be quite uncertain.

**For the enthusiasts.**

In our hands is to begin to develop projects that can function independently of the LLA, in an own ecosystem that allows people to approach the world of video games, experiencing the fun they can provide. If the actions carried out by the people in charge of the LLA did not affect us so much.

In the process we will discover that we not only form the way to have a long-term competitive League Of Legends scene, but also the beginning of a massive esports culture for the entire region.

Playstyles also play a big role in where a player will be ranked in these types of lists. Proof? Look at who the top support players were in past top 20 lists, players like CoreJJ and Mata. Both of whom play an aggressive roaming/play-making style, when there are other supports who fulfil a much less flashy and defensive style, but yet equally good, that get much less recognition.

-------

Why is ranking players in each role separately from other roles a drastically better approach? 

Ask yourself these questions.

* ""Which role has the most impact on the game?"", that would be mid lane. 

* ""Which role has the most impact on other roles?"" That would be jungle.

* ""Which role is the most essential to team fighting in the late game? That would be ADC.

Now here's where it gets tricky, top lane or support, the 2 least important roles in the game right? That's unless top lane is playing a hyper carry, or so is support, then they become more relevant right? Wrong, playing a carry champion only gives you more responsibility to carry. What if top or support was playing a Tank? Less responsibility to carry, but more responsibility to defend, or peel right? So how is this less valued, simply put, it's because it's not ""flashy"".

---------
Summary: Playmakers get more recognition, this in turn gives the outcome of skewed results for each role's appreciation. It's the reason why most of the top lists will consist of Mid laners or Adc's. The most flashiest roles with the best carry potential. But other roles that serve a supportive or defensive style gets less credit, but would that mid or adc who's sitting at #1 or #2 on the list really be able to sit where they are without that Top laner or Support doing their fundamental role?

Sorry for another ""duh rito gib new skin"" thread to a champion that has one of the lowest playrates in the game, but I see Riot has given skins to other unpopular champs recently like Shen, Galio, Nocturne, Zoe, Varus etc.

Support gold income has come a long way from Season 3 where you got nothing and you were a walking wardbot. However, that does not mean that you can spend gold on really bad items value-wise. 

Im kinda tired of Lux players in general who sit behind me and does nothing to only shooting blind Q-Es off cooldown. I realise that these are bad players but even if you climb you see more and more of this behavior. 

Saving 3200+1100 for Ludens + Sorcs as a Support is basically griefing the game. You have the ability to go Ardent (60 AP) + Sorcs + have 700g to spare for that same amount of money, and you are boosting your ADC and increasing your chances of winning.

Started playing again after a year long hiatus just in time for worlds and after a few weeks of rusty play, i think things have started to click again :) obviously, it's not as impressive as my incredible 2 weeks of grinding going from gold to diamond 1 but after a long break and after weeks of experimentation, i think i finally figured out my playstyle for the reworked Poppy.

Needless to say, I still love this game even after being gone for quite some time, and I still absolutely adore Poppy with 1.3M mastery points under my belt. I actually stopped playing right around the time that they reworked Poppy so I am quite proud of this win streak. Anyway, i just woke up and will continue my grind in a bit so hopefully the win streak continues and i have a full page of wins on [op.gg](https://op.gg)! The goal is to get platinum before the end of the year then i'll grind to diamond next season.

Anyway, for any Poppy fans out there or for anyone who'd like to try her out in the jungle, i guess it's time we do another AMA, eh? To get things out of the way, here's the TL; DR from the previous AMA:

Well, I think it's time for me to respond as I am the guy on the post hahaha but first and foremost here are answers to FAQs:

1. Why Poppy? Contrary to popular belief, it's not because she's OP/broken... I think it's the exact opposite. She was so damn weak and like most people, I've always rooted for the underdog. I mained her because I like the challenge (and im a bit of a masochist xD) and I swore to make it my personal mission to make poppy mainstream (hence the 1K+ poppy games each season). I actually started playing Kha when he was released (when his win rate was 40%) for the exact same reason but stopped playing him when they ""balanced"" him out. I haven't stopped playing poppy because as far as I'm concerned she is still a 45%-50% win rate champ for a reason. She's got way too many counters top, she is beyond terrible at farming, she's got significant mana issues early AND late, very item dependent, and picking poppy is in most cases cancer (give out fb and people will ""confirm"" you are troll and afk or qive up).
2. If she's not OP what's up with that Win Streak!? Well, it's a combination of a lot of things. Trust me, a lot of people still think I'm a troll at champ select before or even after they check my match history. I've learned to just keep quiet and muting people allowed me to play with more focus. Also, I do believe that Poppy is best played as jg or as a ""support"" if you get an aggressive and decent adc.
3. Do you have a guide? No I do not. But message me and I'll answer any and all of your poppy questions. If I ever make a guide though, I probably won't focus on builds and whatnot. I'd probably focus more on enemy match-ups in the jg similar to what Opened has done for the top lane. I haven't read any Poppy guide since S2 because at the end of the day, you will have to find the play-style that works best for you. Following a guide would hinder that. As a sneak preview, do not ban Kha, Elise, Lee, Vi, or Pantheon. Those enemy jg are easy to deal with. Shaco and Udyr are much more annoying match-ups if you ask me because they dictate when and where a fight takes place (i.e. if they feel like they'll lose, they can disengage pretty easily but if they feel like they'll win, you won't be able to escape their wrath without flash). Also, speaking of banning, support picks are a priority ban for a poppy. Hope and pray that thresh, blitz, kayle and morg are banned and your chances of winning, go up quite a bit :) Mid lane champs? Ban Grag, LB, or Fizz those mid champs can and will 1v1 a poppy even when both of us are fed.

Riven sitting at 49.5% winrate on an equally high playrate. Oh no she dipped below 50%! Better buff her!

Meanwhile Irelia waaay down there at the bottom with a 45% winrate and not a peep out of Riot in terms of plans for potential buffs/changes. 

""Oh she's just a midlane champ now and her matchups are better, stop whining and just play her mid."" I see this a lot and if that was the case why is her winrate 44% mid on an even lower playrate, meaning that it's pretty much exclusively mains/one-tricks playing her mid? https://u.gg/lol/tier-list?role=middle

The fact is she's just an awful champ all around right now except for the highest tiers of play in the pro leagues, and even there she's pretty situational depending on team comp. Riot has no idea what to do with her at moment with Worlds coming up. They're probably terrified if they so much as glance at her kit she will become pick/ban again.

after that due to mage item changes and other champions getting buffed, Teemo was nerfed more and more. the Shroom Damage nerf and vision changes were never brought up again and he never got any buffs for them.

right now Riot buffed him with the ability to infintly throw shrooms on top of each other. which is nice but goes against the old Teemo idea of being sneaky and knowing where to shroom (the trade off damage for range on his ultimate was a bad move) and they added 2 more slots into his max Shroom count.

now the max slots buff is very good for noob Teemo players (as if I would ever keep a shroom instead of placing them in key locations before a fight or to prevent a lane push in the future) but for the master players it's a frightining warning, because whenever Riot buffs Teemo it never stays. and I can already see them saying something like ""well we gave you more shrooms to use so we are lowering the damage a bit""

fuck that... no other champioon has ever lost this much damage on his ultimate. look at Lee sin with 600 base damage + health damage and 200% AD scaling. wtf is going on there with one of the best cc ultimates in the game? I've seen Lee sin off tank killing people with a single rotation without using their ultimates. they don't even need to aim, just go near a target with ward+W or simply walk to them and then press E, slowed to shit for an easy Q hit.

Riot hates Teemo, there is no going around it. they don't want smart gameplay with high risks and high rewards. they are turning Teemo into another fucking ranged mage that is easy to play with and against like they did with Karma.",2019-09-15 21:59:12

Ahead of the group draw, I have done some simulations to show a visual representation of what groups can occur.  You can read last year's thread [here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/9gfelv/2018_worlds_group_draw_simulations/) 2017's thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/6zbnwv/2017_worlds_group_draw_simulations/), and 2016's thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/51cfsn/2016_worlds_group_draw_simulations/).

**What do these pools represent?**
They are the basis for how a group is constructed.  Each group consists of one team from Pool 1, two teams from Pool 2, and 1 team from Pool 3, which will consist of four teams who advance from the new play-in stage.  To learn more about the play-in stage, please read [here](http://www.lolesports.com/en_US/articles/2017-world-championship-update). **Also note, two teams from the same region cannot be drawn in the same group.** 

#PLAY-IN STAGE GROUP SIMULATIONS
First off, we will simulate some play-in stage groups.  These groups won't come out as sexy, since they are designed to have 1 strong team, one average team, and one weaker team.  To construct a play-in stage group, we take one team from each pool.  Once again, the winner of each group will become a Pool 3 seed, who will then be drawn into the main Group Stage of worlds.

Pool 1 consists of DAMWON Gaming, Clutch Gaming, Splyce, and Hong Kong Attitude

Pool 2 consists of Lowkey Esports, Royal Youth, MEGA, and CIS 1st seed

Pool 3 consists of Flamengo eSports, Isurus Gaming, MAMMOTH, and LJL 1st seed

#GROUP STAGE GROUP SIMULATIONS
Now for the main event, and probably why most of you clicked on this thread.  To recap, we create a group by taking one team from Pool 1, two teams from Pool 2, and one team from Pool 3.  The pool 3 teams are teams which advance from the play-in stage.  Also, two teams from the same region cannot occupy the same group.

**DISCLAIMER** For this visual representation, I am going to assume the pool 3 teams are the 3rd seeds of the major regions (NA, KR, EU, TW).  The main reason I am doing this is because it makes it very simple to plug-in another play-in team.  For example, if you are a fan of MAMMOTH, you can plug them into any of the 4 groups, and if you are a fan of Flamengo, you can do the same, since these two regions have only one team at Worlds, which avoids invalidating groups.  If you are a fan of Clutch, DAMWON, Splyce, or Hong Kong Attitude, however, you would then have to worry about making sure the group works since no two regions can occupy the same group.  In addition, I am sure many people are very interested where Clutch Gaming and Splyce land since this is a Western site.

#I want my team to have the easiest possible group, what should I hope for?

In the past I stated that a team's best hope was to avoid Korea and China.  However things have really shifted since 2018.  The top regions have reached a level of parity. China, Europe, and NA all shifted up in performance, with Korea stagnating.  I would say the best hope for a team is to try and draw Vietnam and LMS from pool 2, and a western team from pool 3.  For example, the easiest group for Team Liquid would be GAM Esports, ahq e-Sports Club, and Splyce.  Easiest for G2 Esports would be GAM Esports, ahq e-Sports Club, and Clutch Gaming.  It becomes more about drawing weaker teams than avoiding stronger teams, since there is simply a larger volume of strong teams (in theory).

Here is a chart of region performance during groups from 2018 onward, you could say the era of Korean dominance ended after 2017 Worlds, so this is pertinent information.  Included are each regions record in group stage from 2018 MSI, 2018 Worlds, and 2019 MSI.

Region | Game Score | Win Rate
---|---|----
China | 29-9 | 76.3%
Korea | 23-15 | 60.1%
Europe | 20-18 | 52.6%
North America | 17-21 | 44.7%
Taiwan | 13-25 | 34.2%
Vietnam | 6-20 | 23.1%



#FAQ's

How are Pool 1 teams determined for the Group Stage?

* The top 4 regions at MSI are put into Pool 1.  That means this year we have Europe, North America, Korea, and China

Why does China skip the play-in stage?

* Since China are reigning World Champions, they skip the play-in stage

How were the pools for the play-in stage determined?

* Pool 1 consists of the major regions 3rd seeds (excluding China), NA/LMS/EU/KR.  Pool 2 consists of the historically best performing wildcard regions: Vietnam, Turkey, CIS, and Southeast Asia.  Pool 3 are the rest.

Why do you assume which play-in teams will advance?

* Read disclaimer above

It gives Yuumi a 900-1100g advantage compared to other supports and she can spike much earlier.

She's fairly hard to catch with 0 CD W. Perhpas giving a **wider window of opportunity to punish her** during her host switching would be a good nerf

Arbitrary reddit analyst numbers: Nerf her her W attachment to 80%-85% speed? but 100% (current patch speed) with boots 2. Capped at 100% (current patch speed).

**EDIT**: **Yes Yuumi is on someone 95% of the time. That means she's extremely safe. The other 5%? She's killing a ward while near an ally or swapping hosts.... she's supposed to be vulnerable at that time, yet it's still hard to catch her. But what if you had a slightly bigger window to CC her?** 

**The point of this nerf is not to gutter her.**

727,What happened to Riot's old approach to skins?,59,d4ltec,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/d4ltec/what_happened_to_riots_old_approach_to_skins/,76,1568589660.0,"I'm sure they've never outright said they had a particular mission statement when it comes to skins, but based on how older skins \~felt\~ better than the skins being released today, it really feels like they've totally changed. And honestly, not for the better. This post is my opinion and how I see/feel about their recent skin releases in comparison to the older ones (4+ years ago).

&#x200B;

For example, skins like [Exiled Morgana](http://i.imgur.com/gq76xhO.jpg), [Mad Hatter Shaco](http://www.lol-wallpapers.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Mad-Hatter-Shaco-Splash-Art-League-of-Legends-Artwork-Wallpaper-lol.jpg), [Blast-Zone Heimerdinger](http://www.lol-wallpapers.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Blast-Zone-Heimerdinger-Splash-Art-Old-League-of-Legends-Artwork-Wallpaper-lol.jpg), [Deep One Kassadin](http://lolwp.com/wp-content/uploads/Voidwalker_Splash_2.jpg), [Veigar Greybeard](https://www.mobafire.com/images/champion/skins/landscape/veigar-veigar-greybeard.jpg), a LOT of them all up until around the first Pool Party skins were released, all felt like they really fit well and followed with how we would expect the normal character to act if they were placed in whatever universe the skin would have them in. They were also, for the most part, very distinguishable, whether it be distinguishing from another of their own skins, or from the other skins ""in-universe"" that other champions received. Like I think at the time of release, the only way you would know that [Headmistress Fiora](http://www.lol-wallpapers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Headmistress-Fiora-Splash-Art-4k-HD-Wallpaper-Official-Artwork-League-of-Legends-lol.jpg) and [Professor Ryze](https://static2.lolwallpapers.net/2015/01/Professor-Ryze.jpg) were associated was by their name being a part of the same profession. Or even low(er) quality skins like [Red-Riding Annie](http://lolwp.com/wp-content/uploads/Annie_Splash_2.jpg) being clearly separate from [Annie in Wonderland](http://www.lol-wallpapers.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Annie-in-Wonderland-Splash-Art-Chinese-Old-League-of-Legends-Artwork-Wallpaper-lol.jpg), or [Apocalyptic Brand](https://www.mobafire.com/images/champion/skins/landscape/brand-apocalyptic.jpg) being distinct from [Vandal Brand](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-M9Sl5Mdv5zM/VhROcDBtOHI/AAAAAAAAydA/FilZXOQQZKQ/s1600/Brand_Splash_2_old.jpg), with all the Vandal skins having clear individuality. And I think that's what Riot has really lost touch with, the individuality of skins.

&#x200B;

To contrast these points and the skins I've used as examples, take some of the newest skins being released now and compare how they feel. Like Riven's skins. [Championship](https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/fcce83ae-8982-4481-a0c7-54c399418dc3/d5o2n4j-5e25cb73-b4d8-4a3a-9b9b-ff1908c1724f.jpg?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOjdlMGQxODg5ODIyNjQzNzNhNWYwZDQxNWVhMGQyNmUwIiwiaXNzIjoidXJuOmFwcDo3ZTBkMTg4OTgyMjY0MzczYTVmMGQ0MTVlYTBkMjZlMCIsIm9iaiI6W1t7InBhdGgiOiJcL2ZcL2ZjY2U4M2FlLTg5ODItNDQ4MS1hMGM3LTU0YzM5OTQxOGRjM1wvZDVvMm40ai01ZTI1Y2I3My1iNGQ4LTRhM2EtOWI5Yi1mZjE5MDhjMTcyNGYuanBnIn1dXSwiYXVkIjpbInVybjpzZXJ2aWNlOmZpbGUuZG93bmxvYWQiXX0.nCIzKMKqkT02jQgpd7EgDF7q2cwhgpIy80ahuJFAsIc), [Pulsefire](http://www.lol-wallpapers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Pulsefire-Riven-Splash-Art-4k-HD-Wallpaper-Background-Official-Art-Artwork-League-of-Legends-lol.jpg), and [Dawnbringer](https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/006/322/107/large/chengwei-pan-dawnbringer-riven-splash-final.jpg?1497694361) are all coming pretty close visually (with Pulsefire and Dawnbringer being the closest), and [Dragonblade](http://lolwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Dragonblade-Riven.jpg) and [Valiant Sword](https://i.redd.it/a62powslw7m31.jpg) seem like they're almost in conflict with one another, like a successful vs. unsuccessful parallel. How about, if you can't see it from that perspective, then thematically? For this Immortal Journey skin line, why are Nami, Morgana, and Talon a part of it at all? Nami is a Vastaya who's only link to the surface world is a weak connection to Targon. Morgana has absolutely no links to Ionia at all, and the focus of her main story is centered around her duality/conflict with Kayle, and if they're linked to anywhere thematically, it's Targon (the most) and Demacia. And Talon??? Was he just thrown in there for good measure? 

&#x200B;

How about, if you don't see it from those perspectives, [just look at the numbers](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Champion_skin/Skin_themes). Project has an astounding 24 skins within that universe ([Nami shows up there again](https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f0751da039ef38bec31c8172b0d8a7a9a70c5bf278b3f3e3d25ac54cd7a785b8.jpg)... you know the fish/mermaid...  I know it's advanced tech but just a more subtle example of a forced skin). Star Guardian has 20 skins if you count the ludicrous cash grab that is the Pajama Guardians line. And there are multiple skin lines with well over 15 installments but I'm not going to try to make this post that much longer. I'm also not counting explicit Holiday themed skin lines in this post (unless they make a separate skin that feels about 6º of separation from a holiday one). But I digress, these numbers all but prove a concerning lack of creativity, and with some like PJ Party, or dare i say the [Prestige](https://i.redd.it/jz9rbhdpqrm31.jpg) concept ([remember back when riot decided that recolors and similar skins lacking the difference between those and the original champ weren't enough to be considered skins and chromas were birthed...?](https://www.nerfplz.com/2015/04/new-chroma-packs-on-pbe-next-update.html)) are such blatant exploits for the players' money that I literally have 2k RP in my account and just haven't felt the urge to buy a single one of the recent skins. (P.S. I'm aware they have my money already, but their saturation of sub-par skins makes me just sit and hope they eventually come up with something good)

&#x200B;

And just to make sure I'm totally clear, I'm not ripping Riot saying that ALL of their new skins are uninspired and copy+paste, some of them are actually awesome like [Dark Cosmic Jhin](https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/018/724/051/large/bo-chen-dark-cosmic-jhin-final-splash-1920.jpg?1560454527) and [Karma](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D9DBGtvU0AA55O6?format=jpg&name=4096x4096), [The Odyssey line](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/a/a1/Odyssey_2018_Promo_01.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20180913135244), and [Mecha Rengar](https://am-a.akamaihd.net/image?f=https://news-a.akamaihd.net/public/images/pages/2017/november/mecharengar/img/mr-wp.jpg). And no matter how the skin fits into the game, it's undeniable that their technology and skill in actually creating has skyrocketed, just compare the[Black Alistar](http://i.imgur.com/Fxcw9Qk.png) art to [any](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Qv3WBuSDim4/W-MUyzJJcrI/AAAAAAAAHY0/ViX-s9OPa_QhBheDcphXlrYM0pVRO2dZQCLcBGAs/s1600/Soaring%2BSword%2BFiora%2B%257E%2BLeague%2Bof%2BLegends%2B%255B%2BAnimated%252BBGM%2B%255D%255B60%2BFps%255D%2B%255BWallpaper%2BEngine%2BAnime%255D.PNG) [new](https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/014/464/395/large/kelly-aleshire-odyssey-sona-splash-art-hd-4k-wallpaper-background-official-art-artwork-league-of-legends-lol-2.jpg?1544056520) [skin](https://i.redd.it/rayez4tcmwi31.jpg) [art.](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-GiezkKLI4bA/VwQKGA5JQlI/AAAAAAAANBE/bOU28XpdbxMOnXyJxB3A_mnwnehx25Qbw/s1600/Urgot_Splash_1.jpg) But still, if you look at all the skins released and [sort by release date](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Champion_skin/All_skins), it's almost scary how almost every skin release has become a group skin drop and centered around events that celebrate them (Now new and improved! Removed those pesky RGM's!)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TL;DR - Kind of disappointed in the turn Riot has taken these last couple of years, lots of uninspired work with constant new additions to skin lines that already have 10-15+ skins in them. I can appreciate the literal work they do with the art and the particles/fx and the detailed stories they create, but it just doesn't feel as great as it used to. Older skins maybe aren't so flashy, but still feel great. Anyways plz don't flame me, just sharing my opinion and hopefully helping some others that feel the same way to articulate their feelings :)",2019-09-15 19:21:00

Maybe average number could be over 50 per champions. Anyway, the point is Riot is making skins for popular champions such as Ezreal, Lux, and Ahri while 1000 club exists. Riot hasn't really share much information about how they make skins except Pool Party Ahri will only be released if Riot is in emergency state of budget. I am not saying that people should stop giving out ideas or draw fan-art. I am just wondering if Riot has to ask any copyright to person who introduced the idea or drew concept art about whichever skin line. For example, I see a lot of good concept and fan-art about Elderwood Kindred, Star Guardian Taric, and bunch of others to mention. Somehow Riot dodges these cool concept and release Elderwood Ahri, Veigar, and Nocturn. Is copyright involved or is it other way around? Is there any artists out there who were being asked by Riot to use their arts for skin development? I don't know why Riot is having trouble making skins that people actually wants.

They'll probably make hype plays but there's only so many times you can see the same champions over and over again and considering the constantly growing community dislike of Pyke more people are going to call bs if he makes some clutch play and escapes on 3 health rather than get excited, and Rakan has been a top tier support for multiple worlds in a row now. 

Yuumi isn't popular with the community either but shes also capable of making really hype plays, being far more mechanically intensive than any other enchanter as well as riskier credibly fresh and unique and the potential bot lane combos that could be really hype just wont happen if she gets forced out of the meta so hard.",2019-09-15 19:03:18

So I saw [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/d3nxlb/i_wrote_a_tool_on_leaguepedia_that_you_can_use_to/f06alvd/?st=k0klzjcm&sh=17848efe) comment from u/MrRyn where he uses d4 and d8 dice to simulate the Worlds 2019 group draw(assuming the 3 major region's seeds, CG, Damwon, and FNC/Splyce make it through along with Royal Youth) which resulted in [these](https://imgur.com/a/VEinVAv) groups. 

I wanted to take this further for some reason because I was curious and we were already running on rng, and I also saw something similar in r/hockey during playoffs. I decided to take MrRyn's group draw simulation and run a whole group stage and playoffs simulation using coinflips. 

The actual format is pretty simple because I have labeled pretty much everything important. The team that is on the left is the ""Heads"" team, and the team on the right is the ""Tails"" team. Whatever the coin landed on is the winner. Each team plays 6 games in groups like normal Worlds, and is double round robin with two ""weeks"". 

For the playoffs draw it was a bit complicated on paper because it has to be 1st vs 2nd and also teams from the same group cannot be on the same side of the bracket. This sucks for a simulation because its pretty difficult to figure this out with coinflips, so I just made a random Challonge generated bracket and it legitimately made a working bracket on first try.

Some interesting tidbits:

- Every 1st seed in the groups did not make it out of groups, even the 2 of the Pool 2 1st seed teams from minor regions(Gigabyte - Vietnam, J Team - LMS)

- Cloud9 is again the only NA team to make it out of groups, even having to break the NA vs EU tiebreaker curse and beat G2 for the 2nd seed

- TL sucked Week 1 and CG did good Week 1, but both of them got hit with the 0-3 NA Week 2 curse",2019-09-15 18:40:53
735,MMR Hypothesis: Unranked Placement / Poor New Ranked Player experience,1,d4l9mt,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/d4l9mt/mmr_hypothesis_unranked_placement_poor_new_ranked/,11,1568587178.0,"***Background***

For now, this is just a mental exercise.  I'm a programmer and so if motivated enough might actually run the numbers and see the results (or if someone else wants to, that would be great too), but for now just wanted to get some feedback on the idea to see if it is solid.

&#x200B;

I'm a silver 3 adc, and one thing I've noticed is that Unranked players (players with less than 10 ranked games) who this is their first ranked season get placed at around Silver 2 MMR and I get one in my games about 1 in 15 times in my experience.  In my experience, these players almost always at the Iron skill level, perhaps Bronze in rare cases.

My issue with this isn't that it hurts my MMR unfairly; statistically, over a large sample of games, the % of games I have an Iron-skill player assigned on my team in this fashion is equal to the times it happens to the enemy team.

So this is not a complaint saying my MMR ""should"" be higher.  It isn't and I am where I am.

The issue is that in 1 of 15 days, my time is simply wasted because matchmaking is unfair.

Also, this experience is a terrible one for new Ranked players if my hypothesis that their skill level is in the Iron/Bronze range (on average) is correct.  If so, they will have a 70% loss rate or so and derank to Iron, in the process ruining 50 games or so.

I want to be clear I am not at all personally blaming these new players, in fact, most of them have been really nice and many even tell their team they are very new and are sorry for feeding.  I try to be supportive of the players and offer some hints, but I still feel it is a waste of time for everyone concerned that could be prevented.

Adjacent to this issue is the problem of smurfing, but let's solve one problem at a time.  Even if smurfing still exists, solving this issue would still improve the game experience of a significant sub set of players.

&#x200B;

***Solutions***

Before getting into any solutions for this, let's focus on step 1 which is proving the problem exists or not.  There is no point in solving a problem if one doesn't exist.

&#x200B;

***Proposed Hypothesis***

My Hypothesis is that Unranked players in their 1st season are assigned an Initial MMR of Silver 2 or so and that their skill level is actually on average around Iron 2 which is a significant gap.

&#x200B;

To test this Hypothesis, I recommend using Riot Matchmaking Stats from their API together with a significant sample of Ranked players who have played in the week ending 2 months ago.

This sample should consist of two groups:

* *Group A:* Players who are in their first Ranked season and have previously played 10 games or less.
   * This set should be a randomized set across all regions the Riot API reports consisting of 1000 players
   * Once this data is collected, the median MMR should be calculated (I believe it is around Silver 2).
* *Group B*: Players at Silver 2 MMR (or whatever the median MMR from the previous step was) who have played 100 ranked games or more (across all seasons) with a minimum of at least 20 games in the last 90 days.
   * This set should be a randomized set across all regions the Riot API reports on consisting of 1000 players.

Now, look at the next 2 months of games for each player in each of those group and collect the following stats:

* Number of games played
* Ending Rank (as well as Change in Rank)
* Win or Loss Rate %

***Data Aggregation and Conclusions***

Next, aggregate the data by calculating the median experience for each group, as well as each decile (10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, and 90%).

That will give a distribution by decile of each of these stats which can then be graphed to make conclusions easier to draw.

If my hypothesis is correct, all 3 of these stats will show significant divergence from the other group.   If these stats are very similar between the groups, that would show no problem exists, but if they are significant, that would indicate a significant matchmaking issue in this area.",2019-09-15 18:39:38

Similar to how inters are 'dealt with', you still can't go into ranked queue with the good faith that your play matters.

I've fallen behind with early game comps and won late because an opponent flamed and went afk. I even won my recent promos easily because the support went afk after 10 mins. How will I improve if I can rely on the 30% chance that I can win without trying?

I'd suggest that if a game ends with a player inactive for over half the game, the remaining players on their team should not lose the same amount of LP as they would in a balanced game. At the very least, there ought to be a Loss Prevented for those on promos with an afk player.

This issue, along with others, highlights the feeling of powerlessness you have when going into ranked, having to rely on randoms to not feed or flame all game, if you're lucky enough for them to not afk or run it down.",2019-09-15 18:01:40

751,Will this years top 20 players at worlds be the most controversial yet?,757,d4kesq,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/d4kesq/will_this_years_top_20_players_at_worlds_be_the/,736,1568582763.0,"[Worlds 2018 top 20](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/worlds-2018-top-20) 

One of the best things about worlds is reading through discussions about the top 20 list. This years list is likely to be the most controversial list ever. There are many players that you can make an argument for being #1 this year, unlike last year where Uzi was the indisputable #1.

752,Morgana Top Lane: The Ultimate Mordekaiser Counter?,37,d4kb9n,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/d4kb9n/morgana_top_lane_the_ultimate_mordekaiser_counter/,59,1568582223.0,"'Sup guys. So, I was thinking about it and I think that Morgana wrecks Mord in almost every aspect. First off, as we all know, Mordekaiser's AP, so the Black Shield blocks all of it's damage. It also denegates his E, and post importantly, his ultimate. But the funny part is that EVEN if he ults you, you're completly safe, 'cause the guy is absolutely inmobile, and with just a Q and R if needed, you're good to go. This also makes it impossible for him to turn ganks, you can just black shield your jungler or yourself and his R goes on CD while both of you wreck him. Also, the Morgana W obviously outpushes and outranges mord's Q, so there you have another reason. The guy can't even run away from ur R in any way. 

So what do u guys think? Is this a counterpick we should all consider? Imo she wrecks him pretty damn hard.",2019-09-15 17:17:03

755,Balance Team = B-Team: Akali's shroud Edition/Counterplay,15,d4jwhz,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/d4jwhz/balance_team_bteam_akalis_shroud/,12,1568579857.0,"Hey Summoners,

Been thinking of creating a weekly post called Balance Team = B-Team and putting some decent thought into current controversial elements of League of Legends. I am by no means a writer/dev just an avid Challejour player (just like the rest of us) but wanted to take some time to put my idea's out there and with some hope provide perspective to anyone taking the time to read. I promise to keep this short and sweet.

So for my first post I decided to start small with something that IMO could incite some amazing conversation surrounding counter-play in League of legends.

We have easy, albeit band-aid solutions for things like Akali's shroud but we keep throwing numbers adjustments and mechanical changes at her. ie. Mini stun removal.

So balance team, how do we fix it? 

Simple: Put counters back in the game.

Abilities: 

Make Hawk Shot/Quinn W reveal...in addition to others. Let Lee Sin reveal her again with E. Adjust champions or items in the game so they can counter these broken abilities/kits.

Items: 

Who cares if you have to buy a 1300 gold QSS to counter an ability? (Hello, Malz!) It's the reason why cleanse doesn't negate it, it shouldn't be for free as a summoner spell. ""Delaying power spikes"" in order to stay safe is an actual tactic applied in League of legends. Look at any pro matchup vs Malz. 

Or if you spend 300 g every 6 minutes in ARAM because your against a Teemo to buy Oracles Extract. It's called the ""Teemo tax"", you *can* risk it and try to avoid the shrooms or you BUY your counter play. We need more things like this in League. 

Balance team needs to take a different direction, numbers don't fix broken abilities. As an example: Take ALL the damage from Malphite's ult and it's still a good ult.

Well, I kept it short and sweet as promised. If anyone has anything else they would like for next weeks ""Balance Team = B-Team"" post, but sure to comment. Thank's for reading.

tl;dr: Make counterplay great again!",2019-09-15 16:37:37

Riot definitely has things they need to fix. Just want to clarify that as well. Some really dumb bugs and the ladder ofc.

I've been playing League since 2012, what I realized is most of the feedbacks from the things you accomplished in the game stopped being so subjective, like the Drake, controling vision (scuttler, different types of trinket), smites, winning in lane (plates) and so on... Part of league fun is the team fights, outplays, 1v1s etc; But an essential part of League is farming.  


Well, I just think there could be a way to make laning and farming funnier and better to play/watch.  


Like different types of minions, for example: Three kinds of waves, every time, one is more tankier, the other one if you get all of them you get a little something, like a mana potion (I suck at balancing so dont judge me for that, its just an idea on how this could affect the game as a whole), or even just minions with different kinds of attack, which maybe would force you to play more deffensive, you couldn't push as fast, or ones that would losing their hp faster once they get in battle with the others idk.  


Maybe if just the visual feedback  improved instead of that little line as a health bar that never changed, could make a huge difference.",2019-09-15 16:26:45

I think that there are a lot of players who would rather wait 2x longer for the game but actually get one of the two roles they have chosen instead of getting autofilled for role they have no idea how to play.  


Autofill is extremely unfriendly for botlane players. If you get an autofill support you are not going to have a nice time, if you get an autofill adc then also you are not going to have much fun on bot. As every other lane is up to a player itself, bot lane is played by two people and forcing someone to play the role they have absolutely no idea of how to deal with is simply unfriendly.  


But imagine if autofill could be turned off. You would probably wait 2x longer for the game but everyone in your team would get the role they wanted. If you would like a faster queue you'd simply turn the autofill on.

***Why are my teams so SHIT?***

On my uni break, nineteen years old, and for the past week I've devoted my life and soul to nothing else but climbing out of Gold tier. I ate and drank in front of champ select. I flamed, I coaxed and I encouraged. And by golly gosh was it difficult. It was more difficult than my Finance finals this semester. It was more taxing on my mental than teaching kids English and Maths.

It was even harder than the first stiffy I ever got.

&#x200B;

But here it is.

&#x200B;

If you're a victim to the constant rantings of a Gold tier friend or if you're an aspiring, sweaty Gold player yourself, I present to you my Findings.

&#x200B;

In order to understand the mind of a gold player, one must first understand what gold is.

So what is gold?

Gold tier in League of Legends is the in-between. It's like what Hopper falls into connecting the Upside-Down and the world as we know it. It's the place where Pokemon go to in their PokeBalls. It's where JK Rowling sends Harry Potter after he supposedly dies. It's so uncannily similar that just like how Potter gets sent back to face Volde-Hell you get shat out of your promos right back into Elo-Hell.

Gold is the limbo place between trash and good. Gold is the limbo place for players who don't have an identity, are good but not good enough and occasionally you'll find the one bad egg that makes you wonder how the hell they even made it here.

I was twelve when I started playing League of Legends. I'm nineteen now. Through seven years of trialing every role, testing every champion, traversing every nook, crevice and cranny of low-elo, I think I've come up with a scientifically certifiable method to climbing out of Gold. Without further ado, I call it the '***Micro-Macro trade-off theory***'.

You see, League players observe Darwinian evolution just like any other biological semblance on this Earth. Ever since the days of pressing D to Dance, gold players have come a long way. People say that Gold players are trash - but I disagree. Through nine whole years seasons of evolution the Gap between Gold and Diamond players is closing. They're no longer super hot trash in lane. They know how to CS, how their champions work, how much damage they do and when they have lethal.

But as the name of the theory suggests - the greater a gold player evolves in his/her micro play, the inherent trade-off determines a decrease in macro play.

Let's draw a few scenarios to dispel any possible confusion. (BS - Blue Side (bottom left) , RS - Red Side (top right))

&#x200B;

**1. Gold junglers will gravitate to the side of the jungle with more camps.**

*RS Lee has backed. RS Bot is currently pushing the wave. Infernal dragon is up. RS Lee has 2 top side camps and one bot side camp. RS Mid/Top is even. Following my first finding RS Lee will now head to top jungle to clear his two camps.*

Is there anything wrong with this scenario? **Fuck yes.** If Lee heads top without knowledge of BS JG, BS JG gets a free kill bot leading to a dragon. But RS Lee doesn't give 2 shits. He'll head top without telling bot, without knowing that heading top was wrong. Then he'll begin to complain, why didn't you guys ward, why didn't you guys back off?

&#x200B;

**2. Gold ADCs will always head to a lane with highest CS density.**

*It's 40 minutes in. RS has no vision of BS but has vision of baron. Following my second finding, RS Vayne ADC will head to bot where there is a stacked wave crashing into the nexus turrets.*

Again, is there anything wrong this this scenario? Again, **fuck yes.** If ADC heads bot without vision of BS. BS gets to pressure Baron for free since RS lacks DPS. But RS Vayne doesn't give 2 shits. She'll head bot without knowing that heading bot was wrong. Then she'll being to complain, why didn't you guys just wait for me, why did you guys even go into a 4v5?

&#x200B;

Gold mechanics might be catching up, but the inherent trade-off ensures that they stay gold forever. They're never actively thinking about how they can play the map, but instead, just **let the map play them.**

Again, correct me if I'm wrong but the reason why high-elo games end so much faster is that they're able to stay on top of the game, constantly pressuring turrets and the map correctly without giving an inch. But Gold players will give you as many inches as it takes for them to get more CS, get more kills and more deaths and get more tilted every game they play.

&#x200B;

So in order to combat this blatant deficit, I picked up the support position.

Proof: [https://imgur.com/iGZ1VUE](https://imgur.com/iGZ1VUE)

Hold up. I know what you're thinking.

*'How can you climb with support when you can't actually carry?'*  
*'You must've got lucky with good teams and got out.'*

But frankly that's not the case. When an experiment is reliable, it means that it can be tested over and over again and produce the same results. And as you can see the results speak for themselves. The biggest factor that you can abuse in Gold games is not your mechanical advantage over your opponent in lane after killing them one or two times. It's also not your ability to roam bot and pick up a kill on the ADC or a solo kill in top lane.

The biggest factor you can abuse in gold is the enemy team's lack of a good shot caller and good map awareness.

Yes, let me repeat that; **the enemy team's lack of a good shotcaller and map awareness.**

&#x200B;

Stop blaming your jungle if he heads top when Drag's up. *YOU PING THE DRAG AND TELL HIM TO COME NOW.*

Stop blaming your ADC if he heads bot when Baron's up. *YOU PING THE BARON AND TELL THE ADC TO COME NOW.*

Stop blaming your top when he heads off to split-push. *YOU PING HIS TELEPORT CD AND TELL HIM TO COME NOW.*

&#x200B;

Just because your team are clueless pieces of macro shits does not mean you have to be one as well. **If you know something, say something.** Being a silent observer of a crime is just as guilty as the offender. That's why support is so good. There's not much for you to focus on in the games so focus on observing and communicating with your team how to move around the map. And if they don't listen to you, name them and shame them.

&#x200B;

Picking support is an investment. Once you make the investment, now a kill in the botlane means two turret platings and a dragon. Now a roam up midlane equals enemy midlane to back and an invade for deep wards in the enemy jungle quadrant. Now a dive up in the toplane means first turret and a free Rift Herald.

&#x200B;

Moreover, supports are kitted with some of the most impactful CC tools and abilities in the game so learning how to use them properly are genuinely game changing. Some that come to mind are Blitzcrank Hook + Knockup, Thresh Hook + Lantern and Zyra's snare + Ult. Learning how to properly ward around objectives and playing around the fog of war and enemy vision will guarantee you to land a few of these game changing abilities and turn the tables in your favor.

&#x200B;

Lastly, playing a good support affects **two people during laning - thats 2/5** and eventually everyone on the team post-laning. Your ADC will never be completely senseless so if you're a decent support, there's a great chance that you can abuse their auto-filled support as well - ensuring that your bot duo never goes 0-15. Again, bot lane's early game proximity to dragons, objectives as well as the support's ability to abuse Mobility Boots for roams spreads a single advantage in one lane to multiple lanes and eventually to decide the game.

So the next time you wonder why your bot lane is feeding their arsecheeks off or why your jungle seems to be power-farming as Olaf, play some support. I promise that Support will teach you much more about how to beat the game in Gold than playing Zed, Fizz, Malzahar or any other champion. **Just play support. Just do it.**

&#x200B;

**Good luck with your climb, have fun and stay positive :).**

&#x200B;

Any further findings or observations in support of my Micro-Macro trade-off theory will be reviewed and endorsed hehe.

&#x200B;

tldr; Gold players have good mechanics but garbage macro-play. Playing support in Gold ensures bot lane to at least go even and enables your team to secure objectives with good map decisions. As long as you know your macro.",2019-09-15 11:59:25

804,[Lore] #NotMyMorgana -- why Majestic Empress Morgana's lore *MASSIVELY DISAPPOINTS* me.,5,d4hf0b,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/d4hf0b/lore_notmymorgana_why_majestic_empress_morganas/,76,1568561469.0,"Okay, so, for those unaware, the latest immortal journey lore for the three skins just came out. 

Here's [the link.](https://www.surrenderat20.net/2019/09/913-pbe-update-splash-art-skin-bios.html)  

And it gave me a really big sad. This post explains why, with a TL;DR at the end.

**WARNING! LARGE AMOUNTS OF TEXT APPROACHING! WARNING! LARGE AMOUNTS OF TEXT APPROACHING! WARNING! LARGE AMOUNTS OF TEXT APPROACHING! WARNING! LARGE AMOUNTS OF TEXT APPROACHING!**

So, here are the three salient bios, which essentially, all revolve around Morgana...

#BIOS

**Splendid Staff Nami:** ""When the demigoddess Irelia was bested by a heavenly empress, the seal over Talon's draconic power began to weaken... allowing some of his magic to leak into the world. Once a mere fish who dreamed of being a dragon, Nami has received some of this power, and has found her true form beginning to awaken.""  
  
**Valiant Sword Riven:** ""Riven trained with Morgana in the arts of politics and war for many years, but where Riven walked the path of justice, Morgana envisioned a world ruled by the gods alone-- ultimately defeating their master and assuming the title of empress. Now tasked with bringing her friend to heel, Riven must face Morgana in combat... or join her.""  
  
**Majestic Empress Morgana:** ""A feared sorceress queen from the heavenly kingdoms, Morgana looked on with disdain as Irelia sealed away the power of a dragon. Crushing her in combat, Morgana soon realized the young demigoddess had hidden that power away, and now ruthlessly searches for a way to return it to its rightful owner.""

# INTERPRETATION

So, essentially:

Blurb 1: Morgana beat Irelia so hard that her seal started to leak.   
Blurb 2: Did we mention she's ~~embraced the Satsui No Hadou~~ really power hungry above all else?   
Blurb 3: And how strong is our antagonist? Well, strong enough to deliver a no holds barred beatdown to one of our heroes that wants people to go on journeys of self-improvement to become better, more wholesome individuals.   

#THE PROBLEM  

Now, this really disappoints me. Why? Not from the fact that there's a powerful antagonist that curb-stomped our pretty heroine that's dressed up like a sunny day. In any heroic fantasy, if you want to set the table stakes, the good guys have to take some lumps to establish the antagonist, and that the antagonist means business. And no, not from the fact that the antagonist is a dollar-store gender-flipped Gouki/Akuma, either.

But because it was someone who just got a very distinct visual and lore upgrade to be established as a wholesome (if edgy), big ~~tiddy~~ hearted goth gf. 

# PERSONALITY THEMES
See, in League of Legends, there are a bunch of champions who have some common personality trait that runs not just through their base skin, but through the vast majority of their skin line, aside from some exceptions made for ""playful"" skins (EG Gnar's toy box, April Fool's, Pool Party, etc.), and you can usually sum it up with one or a few words. For instance:

Katarina: confident, assertive, decisive.  
Janna/Kai'sa: empathetic   
Jinx: rebellious, goofy (exception being PROJECT is psychotic)   
Gangplank, Swain: authoritative.  Lulu: whimsical.  Poppy: dutiful.  Renekton: ferocious. Wukong: headstrong.

You get the idea. Sure, Odyssey Jinx isn't identical to Star Guardian Jinx, and neither of them are base Jinx or ambitious elf Jinx, but when we see *Jinx*, there's a certain expectation of the elements that make Jinx who she is to be present. For instance, if there was a Jinx skin that suddenly made her as serious and dour as, say, Sejuani, in her skin bio, people would rightfully throw a fit, because that just *isn't* Jinx.

# THE MISSED OPPORTUNITY
With Morgana, who just got a *massive* visual and more importantly, ***lore*** upgrade, this was a golden opportunity to start developing skins for her that really cemented who she was in her new incarnation, what her personality was about, and really show off the new Morgana. And boy do I mean *show off*, because Immortal Journey skins are the hands down most beautiful and spectacular skin line in the game, bar none (seriously, the aesthetics team hit an absolute grand slam here, no questions asked).

But what exactly do base Morgana, Bladewing Morgana, Blackthorn Morgana, Ghost Bridge Morgana, and Majestic Empress Morgana have in common? Basically nothing. What do an empathetic (to a fault) ""big ~~tiddy~~ hearted goth gf"" (she's a lot more nuanced than that, but one line really can't do base Morgana justice), an elf hoarding evil powers, a half-alien cyborg, and a gender-flipped dollar-store Gouki/Akuma knockoff in a dress have in common? Well, just about nothing. Now, here's the thing--the legacy skins, from when Morgana's old personality was a cardboard cutout of a gender-swapped Lucifer could be forgiven. They didn't age well, water under the bridge, no harm no foul.  

*But a late 2019 immortal journey skin?!* A skin that *literally* incorporates peacock wings into its design--a skin that basically *screams* **LOOK AT ME! BE INTERESTED IN ME!**--that the *underlying character* we get towards this glorious piece of visual work is someone that's introduced to us as someone that comes across as a cookie cutter cardboard cutout Saturday morning cartoon villain completely unworthy of the amazing visual work that went into her. Heck, if you just swapped out Morgana with *Syndra*, even that would be more understandable because Syndra is already established as a power-hungry individual who's *literally* above people (in her floating temple) and worked from there.

# UNMET EXPECTATIONS  

So, here's the big problem I have. For people to say that ""this is just an alternative universe, there's a blank slate"", I say that this isn't true. For instance, if Riot announced a new Jinx skin, there's going to be some rightful expectations of Jinx possessing some of her uniquely Jinx-y characteristics. I disagree with the idea that Immortal Journey Morgana was a blank slate. The foundation was *Morgana*, a nuanced character that plays fast and loose with the laws she feels unjust and takes it upon herself to help people who want to better themselves improve their lot in life, while simultaneously meting out swift vigilante justice to the wicked, and needing to try and get that answer correct as often as she can, because she takes matters into her own hands. *Those* are the expectations, because this is her first dedicated skin since her VU (in fact, Divine Sword Irelia was Irelia's first post-VU skin as well, and it's no coincidence that it also turned out amazing, and part of it was that she kept her personality of putting antagonists in their place). So, we *don't* have a blank slate. Those expectations were subverted, sure, but in a fairly lousy way. 

# A BETTER WAY? (AKA AN AMATEUR FAN LORE DEVELOPMENT)
So, now one way to expand that into the immortal journey skin line would be to say ""what if we took Morgana as she is in her base, but made her an empress?"" Now, instead of skulking around in Demacian back alleys and collecting those down on her luck, she's an *empress*. You know, like that wise old guy in Disney's Mulan, except gorgeous?

So, how do we replicate the current events in lore, with subtlety, without making her into a one-dimensional Saturday morning cartoon villain? Well, here's just *one* way off the top of my head.

Morgana is the majestic empress--not because she got born into royalty, but because she grew up on the wrong part of the kingdom, and vowed, growing up, that she'd make life better by playing to the spirit of the laws instead of their letters. And true enough, through endless hours of study, grit, determination, and support from her bestie Riven, she did it, and became a beloved people's Majestic Empress!  

Except, well, being the majestic empress isn't all kittens and rainbows--as empress, she has the *responsibilities* of empress. To make sure that the people are fed, educated, good to one another, to present herself and maintain appearances in order to make people happy to see her, to listen to the grievances of those who did get unlucky recently, and gods (and dragons--who are just about the same thing in the IJ line) know what else. As one might surmise from just observing *real life* leaders (Barack Obama, for instance), the stresses and pressures on an upstanding individual trying to do the best they can by the people they bear responsibilities to creates a lot of stress (know why they call it the *white house*? Because that's everyone's hair color when they leave! Ayyyyy!), and may leave precious little time for personal relationships, unwinding, and so on for someone that might have OCD with wanting everyone to be happy. Essentially, the scenario here is that base Morgana's precious wholesomeness might work for a few followers she collected in a back alley, but it has difficulty scaling up across an entire kingdom, and it puts a big strain on her (as it would anybody else, really).  

So, how does she spend her free time? Well, she just happened to fall in love with a dashing, really confident sea dragon king. In the spare moment when she isn't trying to make *just one more thing* better (you know as gamers what happens when we say ""just one more game! This is the last one! I promise!""), she's visiting her sea dragon king squeeze Talon. Sure, he's not perfect--he occasionally snores, sometimes farts in her general direction, and doesn't look both ways before crossing the street, but he's dashing, he's got a good sense of humor, and generally sweeps bae empress off her feet. She loves him ([Morgana X Talon actually was a first pass at the lore, according to NotQuiteFrodo](https://twitter.com/papuchochoe/status/1172977086048473088))--at least, when she can spend time with him.

Of course, unbeknownst to Morgana (because she thinks the world of anyone unless they're worthless as people in her eyes), turns out, her squeeze isn't all that and a kettle of fresh sea-caught fish. He's a womanizer, gets bored easily, is overly proud, and his opinion of himself is higher than a kite, because everything just so happened to land in his lap his whole life (including Morgana herself). You know, those kinds of people that think they're hot stuff because they were born on third base and hit a single? So naturally, while Morgana's busy being empress (as she usually is), in his easily-triggered boredom, he just so happens to hit on the wrong demigoddess.  

Irelia doesn't take kindly to his advances, challenges him (which he obviously accepts, because *he's* not about to get *shown up* by some girl in a cheerful white dress with sunny barrettes in her hair), schools him in front of his posse, and sends him packing so he'd farm up some stacks of humility, and learn some respect. The next time Morgana wants to visit her squeeze, she finds out that an upstart demigoddess came along, sealed up his powers, and hit him with the indefinite banhammer (or ban...swords?, in Irelia's case.  Anyway moving on...). And, since we're still constrained by Riot's lore, this just so happens to be the straw that breaks the camel's back. When Irelia tells Morgana what happened, Morgana essentially lashes out at her in her anguish (you know, like when you and your friend have a fight, and sometimes you just let your friend vent?), and overdoes it to the point that Irelia gets hurt and her seal breaks (so Nami gets unfished). She regrets it deeply almost immediately, realizes that she's staring down the barrel of some severe burnout without a contingency plan, and just hopes that Talon will come back soon, because she realizes she needs a bunch more help than she's asked for up until now.  

And where's Riven in all this? Well, same sort of origin story--but rather than go all Akuma on her master (the previous emperor), the previous emperor decided Morgana was ready, and decided to retire, so he sailed away and she got promoted. And whereas Morgana is the rightful majestic empress thanks to her political specializations, Riven ***studied the blade*** like a good shut-in (/s) so she could keep whacking the baddies (hey, it's a big kingdom or several, so even a small percentage of baddies is enough for a full-time job and a half) and allow her bff to be bae for the kingdom(s). However, there's only so much that someone who's a gopher and the empress's valiant sword can do, and Riven just hopes against hope that her bestie doesn't become a mental train wreck that goes off the deep end that'd make Riven do the unthinkable.

End scenario.

# SOME MORE ON WHY I'M DISAPPOINTED

So, I think that in League of Legends lore, there are plenty of universes in which it's fairly easy to have a black vs. white, good vs. evil, cut-and-dry, easy-to-understand character vs. character scenario. Ashe vs. Sejuani, Cait/Vi vs. Jinx, the list goes on. Heck, God Staff Jax vs. God Fist Lee Sin just as a friendly sparring match with literally godlike amounts of badassery and testosterone (testGODsterone!) thrown in there. 

However, *Morgana*, who's a much more nuanced character, is absolutely not the character for that (IMO, anyway). Heck, even base Morgana's feud with Kayle is far more nuanced than ""oh, this power-hungry goddess wants gods to take over the world. Irelia and Riven are *obviously good*, Morgana's *obviously bad*, so you should turn off your brain and root against her!""

Prior to this, the Immortal Journey skin line set the expectations for a lot of subtle but interesting conflicts. 

You have: 

**Character vs. Environment**: God Staff Jax vs. mountain is literally this, but good Majestic Empress Morgana vs. her responsibilities, Eternal Sword Yi trying to find the jade sword of immortality, etc.  

**Character vs. Self:** Talon, and his farming stacks of humility so he could start over with a clean slate (aka a Tabula Rasa, ayyyy) and come back a better long white haired anime bishie. Obviously, any of the martial artists in the setting (Jax, Lee, Wukong) doing that badass training are examples of this, and I'm sure the list goes on.  

**Character vs. Character:** no, not the cheap kind. But the more wholesome kind (friendly sparring matches, a contest between Janna and Nami to see who could be Irelia's better healbot), or even just a case of a fight between two good people that you don't want to see *either* one win, because that means the other one gets hurt, and you don't want either of them getting hurt. And, of course, there's always the possibility of God Staff Jax vs. God Fist Lee Sin if a stray mountain range needs some anime-style clearing. Heck, is Fiora's romantic pursuit of Yi filed under here?  

What you shouldn't need is a cheap, on-the-nose, bash-you-over-the-head ""AAAAND, HERE'S YOUR VILLAIN, LITTLE KIDS!""

Or, to paraphrase a very tilted Quickshot:

When Lorelei was showing WIPs of her [Majestic Empress Morgana](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/d3zv7y/majestic_empress_morgana_fanart/) before the lore bomb dropped, this is the Morgana I was envisioning (or someone similar), and unless we get more formal canon in the form of short stories, I am throwing out this one-dimensional Saturday morning cartoon villain, and replacing her with my headcanon.

Iconic league characters (like Jinx) have some constant character personality traits that are expected. Riot's lore team blew the opportunity to translate base Morgana's character traits to her Immortal Journey incarnation, and instead gave us a one-dimensional Saturday-morning cartoon villain in the most gorgeous dress ever. This was a huge miss to crystallize Morgana's wholesome new identity in by far her prettiest skin. The fail is so epic that I need more than two hands to facepalm with.",2019-09-15 11:31:09

I started to work on a detailed League of Legends Team Manager/Simulator a few weeks ago, called **""MyLolSim""**.  
  
**EDIT3: WE ARE BACK! It might take some time to load, since we still have high traffic, but it should be WAY better now!**  
  
  
**TL;DR: I created a detailed Lol Simulator with lots of interaction, own champion pools and runes, real match/soloq simulation, team ranked, strategies and much more!**
  
[MyLolSim - League of Legends Simulator](https://mylolsim.net)  
[Short in-depth guide on how to start](https://mylolsim.net/guide.php)  
[Discord](https://discord.gg/HtNGkHT)  

You start by creating your team, naming your players and adjust their champion pools.  
You can literally give anyone any champion with any keystone, be experimental, get your players ready and help them on their journey to Challenger!  
**All champions and selectable runes are as close to their originals as possible.**  

**You don't have to enter an email address, you just need a cool username!  
An email address can be added later for better account security.**  
  
**Champion Pools**  
You can decide anything about your players champion pools.  
You can make them to insane 0/10/0 Riven/Yasuo OTPs or just casual meta slaves.  
Also you can give them a specific pick orders.  
  
**Simulated Games, SoloQ and Team Ranked**  
There's a Solo Queue option to gain LP and elo to let your players play with 9 other virtual players from other users or just play Team Ranked to show you got the best team.  
You receive a detailed post-game screen showing all champions KDA, CS, Gold and much more!  

**Strategies and Synergies**
You can train your players to play specific champions more to get more champion experiences, work with different strategies (funneling included) and follow different synergies like Xayah Rakan Botlane for example.  
    
**Ladders, Winrates and Champion Metas**  
As already explained your players can gain LP and climb in SoloQ and get higher elo by finding new or abusing already known meta picks.   
(Yeah, there's an own meta.)

All of your players stats can be seen on his own profile. (winrate in general, champion pool, match history, winrate on specific champions)
  
**Tournaments and Contests**  
MyLolSim is in it's first season now and as soon as people started to get used to metas and stuff, we'll start the first big tournament with good prizes like Skins or RP for League.  
  
I hope you have fun playing it, feel free to ask questions and let me know your thoughts!

What many people fail to realize is that, with League's storytelling, particularly with their alternate universes, rather than releasing actual short stories or little cinematics, they usually rely upon visual storytelling. Often, this is through champion's ingame models and abilities, and also within their splash arts, and this is no more present than with the newest addition of Immortal Journey skins. The skins that are important to this discussion are Majestic Empress Morgana, Enduring Sword Talon, Divine Sword Irelia, Valiant Sword Riven, and Splendid Staff Nami.

What we know of the story so far is that, Morgana, seeks Talon's draconic power, which was sealed away by Irelia, whom had sealed it away after defeating Talon in a fight. We also know that, after having been defeated in a fight by Morgana, the seal, Irelia, had placed began to weaken, and some of Talon's draconic power was reintroduced into the world, with Nami having gained an unknown portion of it, herself having originally been a koi fish. Here's their skin bios, just for evidence.

**Splendid Staff Nami**: ""When the demigoddess Irelia was bested by a heavenly empress, the seal over Talon's draconic power began to weaken... allowing some of his magic to leak into the world. Once a mere fish who dreamed of being a dragon, Nami has received some of this power, and has found her true form beginning to awaken.""

**Majestic Empress Morgana**: ""A feared sorceress queen from the heavenly kingdoms, Morgana looked on with disdain as Irelia sealed away the power of a dragon. Crushing her in combat, Morgana soon realized the young demigoddess had hidden that power away, and now ruthlessly searches for a way to return it to its rightful owner.""

**Divine Sword Irelia:** ""Long ago, the demigoddess Irelia challenged a headstrong dragon king to a duel, defeating him before all the members of his assembled court. In his hubris, he lashed out at her, and in return she sealed his power within her sacred blade, so that he might find humility among humankind.""

**Enduring Sword Talon:** ""A haughty dragon king of the south seas, Talon accepted a duel from the demigoddess Irelia, only to be defeated in his own throne room. Humiliated, he lashed out at her… and she sealed his power within her blade, tasking him with finding new purpose in the mortal realm.""

Something else that should be noted is that Talon, or rather his draconic power, is visually manifested in the form of a spectral golden dragon, which is present in both Divine Sword Irelia's splash art, as well as Majestic Empress Morgana's. In game, it's also seen in Splendid Staff Nami's ultimate, and Majestic Empress Morgana will call upon it during her recall, and I'll circle back to that tid bit a little later. We know this to be Taon's draconic power because of the skin bios. Irelia sealed the power within her blades, hence why the dragon is seen floating around her blades, Morgana seeks Talon's power, hence why she holds a portion of it within her hands, Nami already contains a piece of it, hence why a golden dragon head is seen in her ultimate. We can even see Enduring Sword Talon in Majestic Empress Morgan's splash art, albeit just his head.

Here's Divine Sword Irelia and Majestic Empress Morgana's splash arts for proof.

[https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/7/71/Morgana\_MajesticEmpressSkin.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190914050003](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/7/71/Morgana_MajesticEmpressSkin.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190914050003)

[https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/b/bb/Irelia\_DivineSwordSkin.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20180814200210](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/b/bb/Irelia_DivineSwordSkin.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20180814200210)

The spectral golden dragon is not just a thrown around motif used for any Immortal Journey skin, it's only seen with Splendid Staff Nami, Majestic Empress Morgana, and Divine Sword Irelia, all of whom have a connection to Enduring Sword Talon. The only other Immortal Journey skin featuring anything draconic would be Valiant Sword Riven, with a white physical real dragon right behind her in her splash art. Interesting to note, in East Asia, the mythology and culture of which Immortal Jounrey is based upon, white is the color of death. So, not a good outlook for Valiant Sword Riven, in my opinion.

While not incredibly important to the discussion, it can be noted that in Chinese mythology, dragons are sometimes known to shapeshift, occasionally into human forms.

So, we know the story, we know the characters, but we fail to know is what's the motivation, specifically Majestic Empress Morgana's motivation. In Valiant Sword Riven's skin bio, it states that, ""..Morgana envisioned a world ruled by the gods alone.."", so that gives us a motivation for her character, but it still leaves us with one crucial question; why does she seek Talon draconic power?

One of many answers could simply be because Morgana seeks Talon's power to help further impower herself, making her near unstoppable to mortals, which would fit with her goal of having a world ruled by the gods. However, the fact that Irelia, a mere demigoddess, was able to defeat Talon, where as Morgana, a full on goddess, was able to defeat Irelia, leads me to believe this is not the case. Why would Morgan need the powers of a defeated dragon when she's already proven herself capable by defeating the person who beat said dragon?

Obviously, there's a deeper reason within. Majestic Empress Morgana's skin bio even says that she doesn't seek the power for herself, but rather ""..now ruthlessly searches for a way to return it to its rightful owner.""

Circling back to Majestic Empress Morgan's recall, during her recall, she summons a small spectral golden dragon, a portion of Talon's power as we have already discussed. Rather than just grab at it or hold it, she plays with it, lets it fly around her and watches it, and as it begins to dissipate, she reaches for it, not in a threatening way, but in delicate, almost caring way. When it finally disappears completely, she falls to her knees, her face in her hands, as though she's crying, mourning it's loss.

We only mourn for those that we care for, for those that we have a deep emotional connection to, for those that we love. Morgana mourning over the loss of the small spectral golden dragon is symbolic, it's her mourning over the loss of her love, Talon. Notice that the skin bio doesn't just say she ""searches"" but that she ""ruthlessly searches"" she's fully committed to finding and returning Talon's power back to him.

Of course, whether it be a more familial love, something purely platonic, or a romance, one sided or not, is up to debate, I'm putting my money on romantic love, just because I'm a sucker for a good shipping.

If my theory is true, that Majestic Empress Morgana seeks Enduring Sword Talon's sealed away power so she can return it to him, purely out of love, this leaves me with one final question; why is it so urgent?

Sure, she might just be rushing herself because love and she wants her bae back at full strength so they can rule the world together, but there's something that should be looked at. In Divine Sword Irelia's skin bio, it's said that ""..she sealed his power within her sacred blade, so that he might find humility among humanity.""

What if, when Divine Sword Irelia sealed Enduring Sword Talon's power away, she didn't just take away access to his dragon strength and other such abilities, but even stole away his own immortality. The theme of having one's immortality taken away from them is quite present within East Asian mythology, such as with Zhu Bajie or ""Pigsy"" from Journey To The West, and the tale of Chang'e and Houyi.

When Majestic Empress Morgana mourns over the loss of that tiny spectral golden dragon, it's more than just a representation of her love for him, but also of Enduring Sword Talon's newfound mortality, and the fear she has that he might die before she can save him.

Of course, this is all just a theory, and my own personal interpretation of the story.",2019-09-15 09:46:47

Let me explain why this is the best possible thing for League. The whole point of League is to fight Champions, and kill Nexus, everything revolves around that. However Minions interrupt that, having to farm Minions for anything other than XP needs to go. This will encourage more champion to champion interaction, It will Reward OUTPLAYS not just the final Kill. The game would be less Tedious and more focussed on what everyone actually likes to do. 

Laning would still exist, you still need XP after all. But now in Lane all you have to worry about is Lane Control and fighting your actual opponent not brainless minions. With this change League would be revitalized.",2019-09-15 09:41:59
817,The Real Reason Akali is a Balancing Nightmare,0,d4gfpk,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/d4gfpk/the_real_reason_akali_is_a_balancing_nightmare/,29,1568554100.0,"With the 9.18 nerfs to Akalis R CD and damage, it has once again become obvious: Riot has no idea how to balance Akali.

Akali's R is not the issue. The true issue with Akali is her ridiculous W. 

The problem with Akali's W is twofold: it's ability to buy space, and buy time. 

You can't really get too close to the smoke as a squishy, because Akali will kill you instantly. But if you don't go, she can essentially just zone you out for no cost to her, essentially buying 6 SECONDS in the middle of a teamfight. 

This is extremely problematic, but the shroud is even worse. Other champions with invisibility like Twitch and Evelynn are not as much of an issue. Why? Because in Evelynn's case, you know she's nearby if she uses her charm. Not only that, but once Eve comes out of stealth, she becomes visible for at least 4 seconds until her passive reactivates. In Twitch's case, his invis is linked to an ability where, if he takes damage or does damage, he becomes visible and his ability ends and goes on cooldown. In these cases though, this is camouflage, and not invisibility. 

For true invisibility, there is Kha'Zix, Vayne, Teemo, Wukong, and others. But in general, the invis is short duration (about 1 or 2 seconds) and isn't really a core part of who they are. Kha'Zix is not defined by his invisibility. It's not a core part of his kit, it's not an integral part of his identity. 

Akali doesn't have this. She need shroud in order to function, because she is arguably the most unreliable assassain in the game. Zed just needs to R, Q and E to kill. Talon just needs to W, Q, and R. Akali generally needs, R1, AA, Q, AA, W, E, R2, AA, or some other combination. My point is that she is very hard to use, and her shroud is necessary for her kit. It:

1) Gives her the space to Q and proc her passive

2) Gives her move speed so when she does Q or E you, she can proc passive

3) Give her a safe space, so she can E while in shroud, all in you under tower, and dash back to her E. 

This is the core problem. To be able to assassinate a champion, she needs to use her W to hit all her abilities. Lots of champions have dashes, so the slow on the Q and MS from shroud allow her to get to the squisher targets that might be able to get away. This is the other problem: her shroud gives her too much backline access. You could literally walk into five people, shroud, and likely still assassinate their backline. Her shroud is essentially what allows her to kill people, but her kit relies on it to such a degree that if you take it away, she becomes the worst assassin in the game. Her theme is a ninja/assassin, so her W fits in with her lore and kit, but it's ulitmately far too problematic. Riot can't reduce it to 2 or 3 seconds because then it's on such a long cooldown that she becomes trash. They can't take it away for the same reason. Well, here's an idea:

Akali already wants short, bursty trades. To do this, let her actually trade. Let's take Zed, since Zed and Akali are pretty similar design wise (Q and W do damage, Akali E let's her latch onto a target while Zed E let's him slow opponents and hit Qs more easily, and both have high cooldown Ws that increase mobility and are the basis of their kits). Zed can't trade that well in mid, since he's melee and his W is a really high cooldown that an enemy can easily play around. Once your W is gone, as a Zed, you are not trading with the enemy. But Zed has a very good post-6 damage spike. He can reliably 100-0 any target after 6, often without W (since you often use W as a gap closer, you often 100-0 enemies without using the W for an extra Q or E). But Akali can't do this; she cannot reliably 100-0 any champion without using her W. She cannot trade well without it either. She is useless without W. So make the stealth duration shorter and the cooldown shorter (something like 2 seconds of stealth at Rank 1 with a 12 second cooldown, and at rank 5 it becomes 3 seconds of stealth with a 8 second cooldown). She can trade more often, be just as reliable for kills, but avoid having her current issues.",2019-09-15 09:28:20

819,Rework Ohmwrecker into a Splitpush Oriented Keystone/Rune,3,d4gbro,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/d4gbro/rework_ohmwrecker_into_a_splitpush_oriented/,10,1568553324.0,"TL;DR: Make Ohmwrecker a Keystone Rune, not another item.

Hey Guys! It's me, back at it again with an idea I came up with. So, as you may or may not know,  [the item shop is getting reworked at some point, most likely during Preseason.](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/BE56qAN1-item-shop-cleanup) One of the items they're planning on looking at is Ohmwrecker, a really niche item that generally holds a less than a 0.01% pick rate. It's an item designed to facilitate dives by disabling turrets, but towers aren't strong enough to make it a reasonable purchase half the time. In addition, while the combination of stats it has are enticing, it's far too expensive for anyone to reasonably want to take. 


---
Rather than rework it into another item though, I think making it a Splitpush Oriented keystone would probably do it more justice. We have plenty of keystone runes in this game, and all of them fall into at least one of three camps:

* Deal More Damage (All of Domination, Press The Attack, Conqueror, Lethal Tempo, Aftershock, Grasp of The Undying, Summon Aery, Arcane Comet)

* Cause you or an ally to take less damage (Aftershock, Aery, Guardian, Phase Rush [more movespeed means harder to hit], Fleet Footwork [same as Phase Rush])

* Grant utility (Phase Rush, Glacial Augment, Kleptomancy, Unsealed Spellbook, Fleet Footwork, Press The Attack)

We don't have a keystone rune that allows splitpushing champions like Yorick and Tryndamere to better split (we have demolish, but that's about it), but not leave them entirely without combative options.


---
Here's a few of my suggestions on how we can rework Ohmwrecker:

**Ohmwrecker - Inspiration**:

* Attacking a turret suppresses it, preventing it from attacking for 4 seconds. (90-45 seconds, based on level) While Ohmwrecker is on cooldown, gain adaptive force and attack speed. (Suppression duration reduced to 1s on ranged, bonus stats reduced to 33%)

This is just the actual active of Ohmwrecker made into a keystone, with some added stats. Pretty lackluster, kind of an easy way to implement it into the game. This is the most vanilla suggestion for Ohmwrecker.


---

**Ohmwrecker - Inspiration**:

* While near your turret, you and your turret gain (10% Armor) bonus adaptive force and (10% Magic Resist) Bonus AS. (Minimum 5-30 adaptive force, and 20% AS) While near isolated enemy turrets, gain ramping Attack Speed based on the Turret's Missing HP, up to 200% at 25% turret HP.

This is one that rewards tanks for staying by their turrets, and makes diving an Ohmwrecker user much more risky. On the other hand, it gives them the ability to quickly take down turrets as they deal damage to it, allowing them to shred through turrets as befitting a splitpusher. Armor and MR Scalings allow Ohmwrecker users that are tanky (Ornn for example) the opportunity to make some seriously deadly turrets while they're nearby.

**The biggest issue is that tanks could suddenly become meta in competitive play with this keystone, and siege comps will become all the rage.** It could stall games out, especially near the Nexus.


---

**Ohmwrecker - Inspiration**:

* Your basic attacks against turrets deal a percentage of their damage as true damage. Become able to use your abilities against turrets.

**Simplest design, highest degree of risk.** A keystone like this would allow tanks like Mundo and Ornn to use their damaging %hp moves against turrets, giving them a large degree of Splitpush potential. Yorick would be able to use E against turrets to mark them, causing his ghouls to jump towards it. Jax could leapstrike both his turret and enemy turrets. Supports that take Ohmwrecker could heal their turrets, and Nasus could Wither the turrets, making them largely ineffective for that duration.


---
That's pretty much all I got. **I don't reasonably expect any of these ideas to be received well, or even used**, but I thought I'd get some discussion going.

At least pull the wool over our eyes and release skins and buffs for the same champ on different patch notes.

Not sure if you know about this but Illaoi's W had two components, a melee and a dash version. The first isn't considered a dash. It works just like Jax's W and Nasus's Q. It isn't stopped by Poppy's W and it doesn't trigger sudden impact.

The second however does.

This patch was supposed to stop Illaoi from dashing while rooted, which i agree was a fucked up bug, but instead her entire W ability was disabled while grounded and rooted.

Previously if a cassiopeia / poppy grounded you, you could hope to use melee W to win, now however you can't.

She also can't defend herself now if a Maokai or Rengar roots her. Talked about top laners until now, but if Morgana roots her for 3 seconds then she's dead. Previously it was fine because she could just W a spirit and heal herself.

**Note:** Melee W is still usable if W is casted before being rooted and grounded, which is even more fucked up that you can use it sometimes, but you can't use it other times.

**PS:** As noted in the comments, this isn't new. Lee Sin's self W is also disabled while rooted / grounded.

**PPS:** But, Talon melee Q is actually usable. So this interaction with grounding and rooting is not consistent.",2019-09-15 05:30:45

Just yesterday I decided to grind a few ranked games in order to see if I can at least get silver this season. I believe when I first started playing this season I didn't do well. After the first game yesterday where I was playing teeto, my old main. I did surprisingly well and learned how easy it is to cheese lower level players with proper kiting and teeto's shrooms/poison. From here on out I decided to play teemo mainly. I start doing really well and my elo seems to be all of a sudden good since I'm getting 23 or more LP every win. Last night I made it out of B3 from B4. But today, after a few hours of grinding games, I made it from B3 to B1. For extra info - I queue top and jungle secondary. I mainly play Teemo, Jax, and Olaf (I'm not that good at Olaf.) For teemo I take Grasp of the Undying, Demolish, Bone Plating, and Overgrowth with Cheap Shot and Ravenous Hunter as secondary. This helps with pushing do to the fact that you can poke the enemy laner a fuck ton which allows you to get lots of extra health, which helps with splitpuushing with demolish. My main build - Liandry's Torment, Nashar's Tooth, Morellonomicon, Zhonya's Hourglass, Rabadon's Deathcap, and of course Sorcerer's Boots. (I'm not gonna go over my Jax and Olaf build since they're just basic Conqueror builds.)

Even though this could easily be refuted as ""better autofills win"", I think that with the correct hype behind it this idea could conquer the interest of the public, specially if you take the G2 case in consideration and put it in evidence, which makes most people believe that mid laners are the ones that have the upperhand above other roles, but no matter the popularity of an opinion, the first one alone does not transform the last into an universal fact, and so, by having this tournament, we would give substance to the arguments that defend A role takes more skill than B role (even though this idea of a tournament never decides something like that itself, it's just to add another depth/layer into this question that we have + the memes it can generate, just imagine supports winning it... :D).

I don't know how this could fit in the ""pro calendar"" without damaging the always necessary reset breaks + the insane amount of hours that it takes to actually build proper teamplay/maintain individual skill, but I just think this is something that must exist and must be done sometime in the future.

to me the biggest mistake for balance was removing the mana restore passive. not because it was super strong but because it forced her to interact. theres little point of jumping off the adc for a 50 health shield in lane when chances are it will maybe stop the support or adc from getting an extra auto in. besides the fact its cooldown is fairly high to the point you dont even get to use it that often.",2019-09-15 03:04:06

I use 'flex'ability of the queue to get a satisfying game that I WANT to tryhard in. It's a RANKED queue after all.

I know that flex queue is rarely played, i know someone who is diamond 3 in solo q but grandmaster in flex queue. And flex gets the bad mouth of ""oh you just let yourself get carried""  ~~Didn't I hear something about that happening in Solo Q too?~~  but whatever the case, i take it seriously. And thus i despise that so far as i can tell, most people just say: ""It's flex, whatever, lets camp this bush for 10 minutes"" and I waste half an hour or more on a game that someone isnt taking serious enough ""because it's just flex""

I know that this alone wont cause a ban for said player, but this is an image problem. Im sure that this behaviour would be called 'toxicity', even in draft pick normal (which is basicly solo q 2.0) 

Bring back the old 5v5 game mode, Team Ranked, where you could enter as a team. Because then atleast the people that i ask to play with are someone that know what i wanna do or that are as tryhardy as i wanna be.  It always suits the mood.

And maybe there should be a 3v3 game mod. This could happen on some kind of dark forrst map, with a spider instead of baron and only 2 lanes or.... something...",2019-09-15 02:52:59

The complaint from the rest of the community is that she's annoying... but then Yasuo exists, so that's not really a unique problem.

Anyway, here's an idea on making her a bit more interactive without gutting her repeatedly, and encourages her to detach every now and then.

**The longer you spend sitting on someone in your W, the weaker your E gets (down to maybe 50% effectiveness). This does not apply if your shield is active.** This makes it harder to solo carry with a Yuumi attached to you, and makes Yuumi have to actually interact with you in order to maintain her healing. This would have a separate effect per allied champ, and you could have some kind of indicator to show it.

But if we're making her rely on her passive more, we need to tweak her passive a bit too, right?

**While your passive is on CD (and no shield is active), empowered Q hits and auto attacks will lower the CD by 1-2s.** This gives Yuumi a reason to detach in lane (though poking is already a good reason, but now there's a reward for it too), and would give you opportunities to punish her in lane.

And maybe we can give her back a bit of mana restoration with this: **When your shield absorbs its full value, you gain X mana.**

**And then, finally, add a 2/1/0s delay before you can re-attach to someone you jumped off of (scaling like her W CD already does)**. 

From there you can tweak numbers and buff / nerf things that need buffs / nerfs, but I feel like these changes make her much more interactive without significantly changing her playstyle, and entices activity rather than being AFK.",2019-09-15 02:51:16

Just started leveling an alt account on another server and im so sick of this bs. Basically I've played something like 50 aram games already and i think that in almost every single one of them there was an account leveling bot. The pattern is they always run heal+ghost, ap champs (even akali) start with Lost chapter, adcs are going BF (didn't look for item patterns on other classes) pop summoners as the game starts and just run it down while using abilities on the closest enemy/randomly stopping in the middle of the map. Instantly leave post match screen and queue for another game.

This is a complete plague, reporting for cheating doesn't seem to do anything (i'm pretty sure the whole report system works just as good as the ""unskilled player"" report used to. All of the reports seem to be without any value and all they're banning for are trigger words i guess, but thats another topic to discuss). And as i understand that determining if a person is trolling or not and banning real inters may be hard, i have no idea what is the problem with recognizing them. They're bots after all, based on pretty simple scripts and patterns, seems quite easy to detect after a large number of games, especially considering the fact that these end up as level 30 accounts with only aram games played each ending up with \~0-15 score.

I may sound like a salty smurf that's complaining about low level players but i can manage these games with bots- sometimes i win against them, sometimes i win with them on my team, other times im going to lose. Whether i win or not as soon as i see the bot in a game next time i just queue for draft so not a big deal for me. The thing is playing these games is the definition of antifun and i find it discouraging for newer players to try this mode at all- a mode that i myself think is pretty valuable for new players as it lets them not only work on their skillshot dodging but also try out lots of champions and learn their abilities (ARAMS have 3 champion rotations available).

Now, for a lot of players, this seems reasonable, since Fiora's tower taking is perceived as pretty bad for a champ that can pretty much only split push, and in isolation, that's true. But what makes Fiora a solid split pusher is that multiple people HAVE to respond; if only one does, Fiora will just kill them and keep going. That's the strength of her split push, and as it stands right now, she feels really balanced. It doesn't feel like bad players can effectively carry on her, but she doesn't feel like only one tricks can perform either. 

To give you an idea of how powerful this buff is, someone on r/FioraMains did some testing and math [(link to thread),](https://www.reddit.com/r/FioraMains/comments/d414dm/fiora_buff_quick_test_time_gained/) and Fiora takes towers ~*30%* faster. This is completely absurd and will no doubt boost Fiora's win rate by at least 1%, which is huge for a decently high skill champ who already has a 50% win rate (according to u.gg).

EDIT: Fiora's Q also now hits invisible wards, which I believe is the only ability in the game that does this. Not exactly fond of that either, but it doesn't really take any of Fiora's weaknesses away, considering she can take out wards with auto-e-auto. edit: nvm i realized that means fiora doesnt need pinks to kill wards ever yeah remove this buff riot",2019-09-15 02:00:04

The current way Riot is nerfing where she is strong instead of adding more weakness, and eventually she won't be strong anywhere. Here's some of my ideas for changes that they could do to yuumi so she isn't glued to her partner. 

Nerf her heal, buff her shield. Will make it so she needs to make use of her passive. 

Nerf her movespeed buff by half. Give the other half to her passive shield. 

Give her q a small aoe when she's unattached, and give it more damage. Less slow, lower damage, and single target for when she's attached. 

Nerf her early base damage, buff her base stats (more ad, health, and attack speed) 

This last one was what I imagined yuumi would be before she was released. I don't think it's the best idea but I might as well throw it in there. 

Massive buff to all of her base stats. The attached target gets 50% damage reduction. The other 50% of the damage is transfered to Yuumi. Reduce heal, but now heals both yuumi and her target.",2019-09-15 01:39:04

It doesn't have to be a champion but just a part of their kit. It may also not be predictions but just an idea that turns into reality months or years later?


I have ideas that actually turned into reality, and I would like to share it with you guys.


1. Elementalist (Qiyana) - I had an idea of an Elementalist on league which can utilized the four basic elements (Fire, Water, Wind/Air, Nature/Earth). My ideal elementalist is a ranged AP mage and its abilities are similar to Udyr's (the one with no proper ultimate). Qiyana wasn't disappointing though.


2. Reworked Irelia's W and R being ranged -When they annoucned that Irelia is going to be reworked. I began to have this idea where Irelia's W and R become ranged, at first (before the preview or teaser or PBE) I thought of Irelia's W is some kind of a short-ranged poke. However, today's version is better than being a poke (and healthier at least). For her ultimate though, I imagined it being a bursty type that forms a shape once it hits a target (shame, it isn't a flower shape.)


3. Shield that pops and damages surrounding enemies (Ivern's E) - Yeah, it was really an interesting idea. No comment though.


4. Camoflauge or Copying a champion's shape (Neeko's Passive) - I saw this one coming but I don't know how they pulled it off. It's a prediction not an idea.


5. Multiple Arrows hitting one target (Reworked Ashe's Q) - It was an idea that hits one target. Varus and Quinn had the similar things but it's an AoE ability though. I also thought of it as an ability not an enhanced basic attack, like Heimer's E.


Now, these are almost all my ideas and predictions that happened. Can you share yours too?",2019-09-15 01:10:34

I've noticed that when I play a lot, it's possible for the game to make me angry. I feel so silly when a game, that's meant to be fun, makes me feel this way. I've never flamed anyone in chat and I thought I'd write a list of tips for feeling happy and peaceful playing league.

League means a lot to people, and that's okay. It's not silly to care a lot about a video game. You could compare it to a competitive sport or another hobby with how dedicated people are - but there wouldn't be a culture of toxicity on a football team in the same way there is one with league. I believe it's possible to care a lot about league and remain positive while playing it.

&#x200B;

* **Stand up for your fellow team members** \- this is huge. Even if you're not getting flamed in chat, but someone else is, it will make the team feel more cohesive and supportive if you stand up for them. I send a simple, ""hey man, no need to be negative,"" if someone is being very mean and belittling to another player. The effect this has is huge because it solidifies you as a team, not strangers. I never argue back and forth after sending a message like this, because it's not worth it, and will make both your tempers worse. What's more, most people don't even begin to argue with a message like this because it's so simple, and not trying to insult them.

&#x200B;

* **Bond over difficult champions** \- dying to a tough opponent could go two ways - your team flaming you for feeding, or everyone bonding over how hard the player is to play against. I'm a support main, and it's easy to be comforting to an ADC who dies to a skillful champ. I joke ""im scared of xerath (or whoever)"" after a recall, or something like that. This always creates a bonding atmosphere instead of a toxic one.

&#x200B;

* **Laugh at yourself** \- there's no harm in making light of a tough play that you lost. It's just a game after all, and people make mistakes. My favourite pun ever to send in chat was about a super powerful Urgot who pentakilled us - ""wow, he really urGOT us huh"" (yeah im saying this bc my teammates didn't acknowledge my gr8 joke in chat so pls admire). It's also fun to compliment the opposition in \[All\], or make jokes with them, and it makes for a nicer playing environment.

&#x200B;

* **When people are feeling down, pump them up** \- if people are apologising in chat for a play that went wrong, or talking down about themselves, or especially if they're expressing doubt about playing a champion for the first time, it goes a long way to let them know that as long as they're doing their best, it's all good. In additon, if the opposition is doing well, encourage your teammates to keep trying.

&#x200B;

* **Remember that things can't be changed in the moment** \- If you see someone do something wrong, instead of getting mad at them, recognise that anger wastes your energy, and that compassion will make everyone feel better. The mistake has been made and it can't be changed, there's no need to talk down to your teammates about it because they were doing their best in that moment. It preserves your energy to accept it with grace and move on.

&#x200B;

* **Recognise when someone does well, especially if they were having a bad game** \- If you see a teammate do well, it will make you bond as a team to tell them they did a good job.

&#x200B;

* **/mute all** \- if people are annoying you, feel free to mute them and play in peace. Responding to flame in chat makes you less focused on the gameplay. I've muted chat before when people weren't even insulting me, but were insulting other players on my team. Nobody needs that.

&#x200B;

* **Report toxic players** \- If you're bursting to let out your anger in some way, wait until the end of the match. Press report, and unleash all you want to say in the comments. This is cathartic, and a million times better than flaming.

&#x200B;

Finally, if you recognise the game is making you feel angry, step away. You could try switching gears - play a low stress aram, or maybe go into normals for a bit to take the pressure off, or you could turn off league completely. Make some food, do some stretches, go for a walk, pet your dog, water your plants, read a poem - soon you'll be out of that headspace, and that's so much better than letting yourself become entrenched in it.

I'll acknowledge that I'm not that great of a player, and league is definitely much more of a fun way to pass the time for me than anything serious. As a result, this probably means I'm not as dedicated to the game, and it doesn't elicit such emotional responses in me, as it does in others. Just thought I would offer some advice that works for me because flame is just such a bad thing, and it sucks when an otherwise nice league session is ruined by negative attitudes.",2019-09-15 00:31:24

The only moba I play now is dota 2 but I left went to OverWatch when it came out and everyone was leaving league for it. (I'm a diamond genji one trick)

After seeing Wow classic I imagined league back then.

I think they should make classic league, I'd say put it around season 2 maybe early season 3. Those were the golden days at least when I started. Draven had a bleed in him and Darius were blood bros, when there is first came out he was super OPs with damage and his ult reset fom kills as soon as he got it.

 Then they release some super OP champs, Leblanc came out and killed things instantly, like getting hit by a blind nidalee spear that one shot you. Zarya was a super OP midlaner until they neefed her into a support rule. When rengar came out his  necklace gave him +10 AD per level up to 18. His trophies movement speed buffs to his ult which was completely invisible no warning and lasted to the point where you could run across the whole map with it with the movement speed trophies. He could triple q and it has insane ad ratios and who 1 shot people worse than leblanc with crit and his bone tooth giving him an extra 180 ad at level 18 with the Qs it was broken. 

Kkazix was actually good. Oh and there was AP yi, his heal ap ratio to heal per sec was so high if he used it you literally could not kill him, you would have to see see him or wait until it ended. So he could save himself from the break of death and he could take a whole team.

 Which he did because his ap q ratio was also very high he would just walk into a team death fire grasp (which was old dfg, op since it made magic damage stronger) and Q And it would hit the whole team as well as one shotting the one he dfg. Then he would press Q again and end up killing someone else and everyone else super low. And he just repeated this process in the matter of like 5 seconds he would have a pentakill. personally I was getting at least five pentakills per game on him it was so broken. 

AP Tryndamere was also pretty good but not as good as AP yo since he didn't have resets. But he could have little cool down and  Spam Q And the ratio was good to always keep him healed but not OP like yi. But he was still scary

INVASION START

Hey cool a pve mode let me grab my friends maybe little brother too we can definately handle this. We play. We laugh at how pathetic beginner mode does.... Then we start to learn on the proper difficulty. We learn what we need to do what we need to focus we learn to work as a team. We realize eachothers playstyles and start to work better as a team and as friends. Sweet. We are getting good.

THE MISSIONS

The missions are UNIQUE. The missions are CHALLENGING. The missions are EXCITING. We grab some people from our friends list. Not the synergy we have but a team for sure. Through some arguing and team rearrangements / discovering what else we are good at. We do the comps needed. Our backline healer learned that he could also keep us safe on poppy. Our aggressive vanguard learned he wasn't actually bad on jinx and could better dps the monsters he's focused. And the gunner I am as nature takes it's course moved from jinx and learned mf so I could deal with the hordes and jinx could do her job. It made us better players overall.

THE CHALLENGE

The challenge is set. Get that S rank. I tried with my friends but I never got it with them, but my experience with them taught me well and I found a team of higher skilled players. Suddenly I went from the team leader I was and got shoved into the soraka role, nothing I couldn't handle as a support main. This skilled team and I didn't do it first try. Took us a while actually, I accepted I wasn't the leader of this bunch, just directed positioning for those that needed my healing. But I was part of the team, I was valued, I was equal, I belonged. We got the S, i can flex that skill based icon. I'm extremely happy I'm filled with joy. I tell my friends and they are happy for me too. I kept playing the pve event, helping those that weren't quite done. I was the veteran and I felt amazing doing it.

WHY IT FELT GREAT

Unlike SR where we are alone half the game this is constant teamwork. ""*Poppy* I need a hand"" ""*jinx* this velkoz is safe to kill"". We formed a bond we formed a team we formed a better focus. My friend playing poppy started to just feel when I was in danger or have better awareness of some scenario's I got in. I knew when soraka went in deep to go for a vital silence but I wouldn't let her die to voidlings. Soraka knew when poppy was in over his head with the peel and aggro. We overall had a blast working together and I think that feeling we had then was one of the best feelings if not THE BEST we ever had playing the game. It wasn't us vs our feeders. It wasn't us vs our team comp. It wasn't us VS GODAM ARDENT CENSER. It was us... as a team working together

ODDYSEY

The crew is gathered. We play through the easy modes and gather our augments we see which champs we like to play in the mode. I love jumping about with yasuo or smashing everything together we malph. Our soraka takes on a zoning position with malph and ziggs. The poppy/jinx picks up his weapons again and starts shooting what needs to be shot. And other friends I won't go into detail about because actual 5 man this time. We have a wonderful time learning what we are doing wrong and right in the final difficulty.

THE MISSIONS / CHALLENGE

The missions weren't as exciting as before but they were still fun organizing who still needed what. While I didn't find a team of tryhards to do the 2 augs quest with, and didn't wanna break it to soraka/malph that he wasn't skilled enough because he's my friend (I could trashtalk him all day on the rift but never here), I still had fun not getting it done. We all had fun. I still may be salty from time to time that I didn't complete it, but I don't regret playing it all with my friends one bit.

SUMMARY

What I really LOVED about the events, what really got me HYPED and EXCITED, was the teamwork, was the bonds, was the enemy being the game not ourselves. Reminded me of playing borderlands with my older brother, reminded me of playing resident evil 5 with my dad, hell it even reminded me Minecraft minigames with my younger brother. Being close to people and working together to face what you must. Maybe it sounds cheesy but these pve events is where I felt truly close to my friends. Knowing that their gone was a huge blow at first but I'm starting to get over it. But before PVE dies for good is it too much to ask for the team to get back together, fight some void and remember how it feels to have uncontested joy with league of legends. Or maybe I can smash these aliens into a wall while my friend fires a million nados

TLDR

PVE made me feel amazing through teamwork with my friends and through mental connections and my happiest times in league were nearly all PVE. My main hope is that I can gather my star guardians and take up arms against the void once more.",2019-09-14 23:37:06

That being said, I was curious which pro players can actually play this champion consistently because in Europe apart from CLAPS (not Caps, Claps), no other mid laner seemed actually comfortable/consistent on it.

I would assume Faker plays it well to but apart from that I am not sure if Sylas is in the comfort zone of many mid laners right now and I was hoping you help me out find as i dont follow LCK/LPL too much",2019-09-14 22:36:29

928,LEC regional qualifier 4 rounds instead of 3?,0,d48vx8,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/d48vx8/lec_regional_qualifier_4_rounds_instead_of_3/,1,1568513998.0,"I like the idea of having the team that has qualified on points(Fnatic this time) to face off against the winner of the gauntlet. But since that team is already qualified for world, as either second or third seed, it only gives three teams the chance of actually running the gauntlet. This kinda breaks the consistency of the playoff format, that is so vital of the seeding in this league, as the playoffs allows six teams to enter the post regular season stage.   


As the first place team go directly to worlds. And the the team with most points is guaranteed a spot at worlds as either the second or third seed. And with only three rounds in the actual gauntlet, only the third, fourth and fifth ""seeded"" teams(teams with most points) will get the chance of being included. And what about the sixth team? It feels really bad going to playoff, which proves you are one of the top teams in the LEC, but you are not allowed to take on the other playoff teams in the gauntlet!  


The final game(round 3) between the now Fnatic vs Splyce game doesn't work like a normal gauntlet match. Because no matter if you lose this match you will still be going to worlds. Which obviously isn't the case for the round 1 or the round 2 matches. Which kinda doesn't make this last match(round 3) a real ""gauntlet"" match. It is all or nothing in the gauntlet, this last match feels like something else in its current format. I don't know what it could be called though.  


Again just to be clear, I like the round 3 match existing and I know why it is there. But I can imagine you feel betrayed by the system when you are the sixth team on points. Did going to playoff not mean as much in the end? Especially when trying to get as much points as possible from spring split aswell. But the sixth team doesn't get that second chance.  


What do you guys think? Did Rogue get robbed of a second chance? Would there be too many games if one more match was introduced?",2019-09-14 22:19:58

In the other hand we have champs like Twisted Fate and Cho'Gath with much simpler passive, and yes they do have a video to explain it.

like, compare to soraka, the most healing focused support in the game. even if she has just a frostfang, she still has an aoe slow from q, an aoe silence/root from e, and a haste for herself and an ally. sona has purple power chord, which is not a skillshot and has twice the duration and slow amount as yuumi will have, and she's also one of the best scaling champions in the game, so it would be more reasonable for her to be useless without gold anyway",2019-09-14 21:47:45

If I end up using it, the 50 lending fee eventually adds up if I use it a lot. This rune would probably feel a lot better if there was no lending fee, but even then there would be times you would not need it at all.

Minion Dematerializer is also terrible, mostly because the majority champions don't need it at all. It also has been nerfed to only give you three charges instead of six. Champions that used to love it really needed six charges.

After the last nerfs, Biscuit Delivery is also terrible. Awful. Not only the healing on it has been nerfed significantly, but the effects only last 5 seconds. This means Biscuits will heal you for an insignificant amount after the nerfs. Remember that it heals you for your missing health and mana, meaning you must use it when you are low on health for maximum effect, but even then it heals for a pitful amount. Even though it has been buffed to give you an biscuit at 2 minutes, it is insignificant, because the healing is almost unnoticeable.

When I pick Inspiration secondary, I now end up not picking anything from this row. If I happen to pick Inspiration primary, I often pick Biscuits. Even though they are terrible, they are still better than the other two choices, and a small amount of sustain is still better than no sustain.",2019-09-14 20:34:40

I won the first 2 games of gold qualification then lost 3 in a row and didn't advance.

Feel free to add more examples if you think i forgot something, i'll just describe the ones i remember right now.

I was going to add Aurelion Sol passive which has been missing in it's entirety for 2 patches, but with this last patch has been fixed
(at least)

**3. Braum**  
Why does his Q and W say the exact scaling, while the previous tooltips don't?   
https://imgur.com/jh1hFOq   
Differences between his Q and W:    
a: Q scaling is written between Squared brackets ""["", ""]"" while his W is written between round brackets ""("", "")""   
b: Q scaling is *completely* colored in red (as for health scalings) while his W have no colors whatsoever

**4. Level Scalings**   
Usually, values that scales with levels are written in white... Usually, but not always

This might sound like a pitch for a scam, but it's actually doable. You can level up your play by up to a whole tier almost instantaneously by mastering the mental game. Now this isn't a substitute for practice or research. Most of the time when people are given advice on how they could improve they are told things like review your replays....watch streamers who play your role....watch guides on YouTube....and I think those are all fine ideas. In fact, I'm a big advocate of Skillcapped guides on YouTube. But the one thing I almost never hear from any of these sources is how your mental can improve your game.


Straight up, it doesn't matter how much of a mechanical or macro god you are. If you have shit mental you will get hard stuck every time. So here is my 3 step process to mastering your mental for the best performance. 


1. Confidence 


I feel like I might've lost a few of you already. 


""How can I be confident as a hardstuck Bronze player?! I'm trash!"" 


The thing about confidence is that it doesn't have to be based on skill. There are dudes I went to school went that sucked in high school basketball leagues that think they're Lebron James. They have every reason to not be confident in themselves and yet they still are. And as a result they give every game their all. 


If you are not confident in yourself you will only play at 60 percent of your maximum potential. You will not attack openings that would net you advantages. And, more than likely, you will not make the clutch play that will win you the game.


Now, I'm no professional. But if you ask me, the best way to boost your confidence is to suck yourself off. No matter how bad you are, everybody has flashes of brilliance. You made a dank play and got a triple kill bot lane? Go load up the replay and watch the clip of you getting the triple over and over again in awe. Not only will you want to make more dank plays, it will build your confidence. You'll see how good you could potentially be and you'll subconsciously start to build an ego.


Bonus: ranked anxiety goes away with confidence. Obviously not completely, but by a large amount. Every time I get in queue for ranked I think ""Man, I'm about to shit on these guys"". And it doesn't always work out, but at least I'm not cringing when I click the find match button. 


2. Flow


Flow, or as I call it, being in the zone, is the most important part of this guide. Note, this is the second step for a reason. You can still get in the zone if you lack confidence, but it won't be as effective. Let's go back to my example of getting a triple kill bot lane.


You are in the zone. You hit em with the moves, get a triple kill. Your teammates start spamming question mark pings in admiration. ""Gj!"" your team types to you. ""Wow"" the enemy team types in all chat.


Someone who lacks confidence will say "" Wow, how do I do that?"" and completely take themselves out of the zone. 


On the other hand, someone with confidence will say ""Lol, get shit on. Back to Lissandra!"" and maintain the same level of performance throughout the game. And probably take that momentum to the next game as well. 


Right off the bat confidence alone will allow you to play at 70 - 80 percent. And being in the zone will allow you to play at 150. You may be wondering why I said 150 percent instead of 100, but think of League as an anime. No, I'm not saying League is an anime and even if it was none of us would be the protagonist (probably would be Lux, or Kai'sa at this point). But being in the zone is the equivalent of surpassing your limits in anime. You will play at such a significantly higher than normal level that you will be almost unrecognizable. Like get rid of the nametag and you go from a Silver to a Gold/Plat player.


The more you get in the zone the better you will become. By constantly playing at 150 percent you will subconsciously push yourself to the next level. All those fancy plays and 200iq map rotations will become muscle memory. That 150 percent will become normal or maybe even bad to you as you reach new heights. 


How do you get in the zone you may ask? That's a question I cannot answer. You have to find what gets you there. For some people its music. For others, its trash talk. For me I get off voice chat and type to my friends "" F O C U S"" and do just that. I think about what I need to do to win. I think about who is the best player in the game. Are they on my team? Do I need to help them? Are they on the enemy team? How do I shut them down? I immerse my mind in the game state and before I know it I am in the zone. Playing not like a Diamond 4, but like a Diamond 3 and a half (lul).

(How to enter the zone as a gamer)


Final step: Getting rid of tilt


This is my biggest weakness as a player. I tilt easily. There's two reasons for this. One, I am a naturally argumentative person, so I am likely to respond to flame in the chat in some way. And two, I like to think about things very logically. Oh the entire enemy team has a bounty and my team keeps going into the jungle to get picked off? Tilt, ff. This game is a bust.


 I often times take myself out of the game by giving up early when all seems lost. And as we all know, the game isn't over until the nexus explodes. We've all seen some insane comebacks during our time as League players. 


You want to be able to avoid tilt so you can keep your mental healthy and stay in the zone. There's two things that often put people on tilt. Gameplay and chat.


For the first one, if your teammates are playing like a bunch of monkies there's no reason to get mad. Think about it, if you are Bronze or Silver, why would you get mad at your teammates for being shit? They're BRONZE. Lmao, it's a given they won't be very good. Getting mad at low elo players for being bad is like being mad at the sky for being blue. High elo players on the other hand tend to tilt more due to their own misplays. For my Plat+ players, even Faker during his prime made mistakes. And right after he came back from spawn he went back to demolishing some of the best players in the world.  If you mess up it's not the end of the world. You'll be fine.


On the other hand, tilting from chat is even more avoidable than tilting from gameplay. If someone is flaming you Riot gives you more than enough tools to combat this yourself. Mute them. And if they are spam pinging question marks, mute their pings as well. But the biggest thing about getting flamed in chat is that...it doesn't matter. Look at it this way.


Someone calls you trash. Are you playing like trash?


No? Then they don't know what they are talking about.


Yes? Well you know it's true, take it to the chin and try to step up.


If someone says you are playing bad either they are right or they are wrong. And whatever the case is you have no reason to be mad. Why get mad at someone speaking the truth? Why get mad at a random who's stupid? No need fo tilt. Now I admit, this is harder than I'm making it out to be. I have gotten permabanned on 4 different accounts so trust me I know how hard it can be. But if you can master your mental and avoid tilting you can reach heights you've never thought you were capable of before (I went from hardstuck Bronze 5 to Diamond when I stopped tilting).


*Conclusion*


Right now there is somebody out there going through their Diamond promos despite playing the game for less than a year. And while yes, they probably have a lot of natural talent, the main reason they are skyrocketing through mountains of elo while you are hardstuck is because they put themselves in the mental space to do so. I'm sorry to say this but simply wanting to improve won't make you reach your full potential. The mind is a powerful thing. It can control how hungry you feel, how fast you run and it can turn you into a better League of Legends player. If you only let it. ",2019-09-14 18:08:14

978,"More theorycrafting on Mundo, just a fun little idea on what Mundo could've been",2,d45hna,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/d45hna/more_theorycrafting_on_mundo_just_a_fun_little/,4,1568498185.0,"Hey everyone!

A while back I did a post on the direction I would've taken on Mundo's eventual VGU, this post is more laid back I guess you could say. I was just having some fun theorycrafting on how I would've taken Mundo during his current implementation in the game.


So right now, Mundo is still a big ball of stats and he's still somewhat gonna remain that way with my proposed changes but in a way that focuses on the stats he builds a lot. I want to focus on the fact that he builds HP in his build 100% of the time and make use of that in a form that makes him into a late game super Jugg based off a drain-tank playstyle.

&#x200B;

# Passive: Adrenaline Rush

Dr. Mundo passively regenerates **0.2/0.4/0.6%** of his maximum health each second, this increases to **0.6/1.2/1.8%** of his maximum health each second when below 35% of his maximum health.

Levels: 1/6/11

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

His passive as it is right now is great however it really falls off late game as we tend to still rely on a Warmogs/Red Buff if we want that regeneration out of combat. I want Mundo to remain as a scaling champion, it fits him nicely so I've taken a small amount of the power from his early and shifted it into a scaling passive so it can have its use late game.

&#x200B;

# Q: Infected Cleaver | Cost: 50/65/80/95/110 HEALTH | Cooldown: 8

Active: Dr Mundo hurls a cleaver in the target direction, dealing **20/22.5/25/27.5/30%** of the target's current health as magic damage and slowing them by 40% for 2 seconds.

Minimum damage: **80/130/180/230/280.**

Rip and Tear: The cleaver is left impaled into the victim for 3 seconds, during this time Dr. Mundo can recast Infected Cleaver whilst in range to rip it out, dealing **10/12.5/15/17.5/20%** of the target's current health and slowing them by 20% for 2 seconds whilst refunding **60%** of the health cost to Dr. Mundo whislt healing him for **5-10%** of his maximum health based on how much health Dr. Mundo is missing and refunding 100% of the cooldown.

Minimum damage: **40/90/140/190/240.**

If Infected Cleaver hits an enemy, 40% of the health cost is refunded, and if it kills it, 70% of the health cost is refunded.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Infected Cleaver has always been Dr. Mundo's iconic bread and butter ability, current implementation is too stale though. With the way it functions, laners don't really get much interaction against him.

My idea of his Q would of been to take some inspiration from Akali's Q with the ring formation around the target and being able to further reward Mundo for playing more aggressive. This is compensated by an increase to the health cost + CD which would really punish players for not consistently landing their Cleavers.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# W: Burning Agony | Cost: 15/20/25/30/35 HEALTH PER SECOND | Cooldown: 2

Toggle: Dr. Mundo sets himself on fire, dealing **20/25/30/35/40** magic damage per second, this increases to **35/40/45/50/55** magic damage per second for targets that have stood in Burning Agony for more than 4 seconds.

During this time Mundo also gains **25%** tenacity, increased to **35%** when below 50% of his maximum health.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Burning Agony is a weird one, I honestly would want this ability gone when he gets his eventual rework as it's only primarily used for the Tenacity and stacking the MR bonus on his E passive. How I would change this I don't know, for now I wanted to round off the numbers a little and make it more prominent for dealing damage to those that fail to kite Mundo.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# E: Masochism | Cooldown: 6/5.5/5/4.5/4

Passive: Taking magic damage or paying a health cost increases Dr. Mundo's magic resistance by **2%** for 2 seconds, stacking up to **6/12/18/24/30%** increased magic resistance.

Active: Dr. Mundo gains **3%** of his maximum health as bonus attack damage for 5 seconds, increased by **0-100%** (based on missing health).

Additionally, Dr. Mundo's next basic attack, within the duration, will cost **30/40/50/60/70** health, but gains 25 bonus range and deals **2/2.5/3/3.5/4%** of his maximum health as bonus physical damage.

*Masochism* resets Dr. Mundo's autoattack timer.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

At the moment this ability remains as one I think Dr. Mundo can keep through his larger-scale rework however just not in it's current stance. At the moment it's just there as a free AD steroid buff which isn't based on anything he's building, it's just there at a press of a button. It's not worked towards in anyway via the items he builds.

Now this would mean maxing E first is bad, that is the sad part. Many champions are centered around maxing one specific ability every match so I don't think it's necessarily bad for Mundo as his Cleavers can now dictate a lot of the fights if played well instead of just pressing a button and heavily stat checking someone with AAs.

Overall, he will gain more AD late with his traditional builds but a lot less during the early-mid section of the game.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# R: Sadism | Cost: 10% OF CURRENT HEALTH | Cooldown: 100/90/80

Active: Dr. Mundo gains 25% immunity to grevious wounds and regenerates **45/55/65%** of his maximum health over 10 seconds and gains **10/20/30%** bonus movement speed for the duration.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I love this ability. Period. I hate the direction Riot took with it's buffs, I get it does make up for the fact that Grevious wounds exists in the game but it's incredibly stale to play against when Mundo is ahead. Currently the stats on Sadism joined with the increased healing on Spirit Visage almost negate the reduction. I want to give Mundo the chance to negate a portion of this, not all of it.

Sadism gates Mundo's ability to receive other buffs within his kit due to the nature of the regeneration as it is now. Any extra regeneration that he loses from Sadism can be made up within his Passive and Rip & Tear from his Q.

&#x200B;

Now just to note, this is more of a ""What I wanted Mundo to be""  rather than ""This is what I want his rework to be"". I want him to be a scary drain-tank that scales well into the late game rather than just becoming a ""Press R Bot"" like he is now.

&#x200B;

Feedback is appreciated, thanks for reading guys.",2019-09-14 17:56:25
979,Has anyone ever done a study on the psychology of champ mains?,8,d45hat,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/d45hat/has_anyone_ever_done_a_study_on_the_psychology_of/,29,1568498126.0,"I've noticed a certain trend with the way people that play certain champs interact with people ingame, and also with how I perceive people based on the champs they play.

For instance, two champs could be equally toxic but I might deem one player more toxic than the other based on the champ they are playing.

Things get even more interesting when you visit champ main subreddits or visit their discords. Some communities seem super toxic. Others seem friendly. ~~Others seem dead.~~ Others seem downright degenerate. 

It's almost as if certain champions attract the same type of people. Is it the champ kits that do this? Is it the champion design and lore itself? 

I always thought it really interesting and with some people actually doing research projects on things like video games and certain aspects of it, I thought it would be really interesting to know if anyone had done something like that regarding champions and the type of players they attract.",2019-09-14 17:55:26
980,"Competitive LOL viewership, year to year comparison, summer update",768,d45a7r,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/d45a7r/competitive_lol_viewership_year_to_year/,373,1568497094.0,"Hello everyone, following my post on Spring 
[“Competitve LOL viewership year to year comparison –spring edition”](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/bd5eq3/competitive_lol_viewership_year_to_year_comparison/) I have decided to do a new one, this time for the summer split. This stats do not include Chinese viewership, all the data comes from escharts.com.




**Note that because of several reasons summer split has almost always and on every region less viewers than the spring split (mainly the regular season games) so I will be comparing summer to summer just like I did a few months ago spring to spring**
**Pro view is not taken account, LEC finals for example had, at peak 30k people watching with pro view.**







**LEC (Europe)**


**Avg viewership:**
2019 summer split: **170 364** which is **+49.53%** compared to summer 2018


**Peak viewership:**
2019 summer split: **841 147** which is **+72.11%** compared to summer 2018



After an already big growth of +32% on spring split, the summer split grew even more to a fantastic +49.53% making of the region, if we exclude Chinese viewers, both the most watched in terms of avg viewership and peak viewership. In fact the G2vsFNC bo5 on finals had the biggest peak of a non-international event of the last 3 years on every region but China.




**LCS (North America)**


**Avg Viewership:**
2019 summer split: **158 232** which is **+1.01%** compared to summer 2018


**Peak viewership:** 
2019 summer split: **494 765** which is **+15.03%** compared to summer 2018


In general LCS seems to be stagnated having less avg viewership in spring **(-6.7%)** and slightly more viewership on the summer (**+1.01%**) when compared to 2018. 
However, the diference in the year to year viewership is very low and this 2019 summer split has for example had more viewers than both 2018 (+1 500 avg viewers) and 2017 (+13 000 avg viewers) so LCS is neither losing viewers neither gaining them.





**LCK (Korea)**


**Avg viewership:**
2019 summer split: **117 211** which is **+6.81%** compared to summer 2018


**Peak viewership:**
2019 summer split: **774 456** which is **+28.48%** compared to summer 2018


A pretty good year for LCK viewership wise as they grow **+26.6%** in Spring and **+6.81%** in Summer or maybe even a bit more as I believe Ambition`s stream is not taken account (it is not official) and it has often 20-30k viewers. Chinese viewership is also not included for not being reliable. SKT is by far the most watched team and just the fact they are doing well boosts the viewership by a lot.




**CBLOL (Brazil)**


**Avg viewership:**
2019 winter split: **97 115** which is **+42.79%** compared to winter 2018


**Peak viewership:**
2019 winter split: **315 859** which is **+46.95%** compared to winter 2018


Note that I believe CBLOL can also be seen on a tv channel, those viewers might not be taken account. 
This was probably CBLOL best year with a growth of 27.81% and now 42.79%.




**VCS (Vietnam)**


**Avg viewership:**
2019 summer split: **67 107** which is **+100.92%** compared to summer 2018


**Peak viewership:**
2019 summer split: **280 397** which is **+56.68%** compared to summer 2018


Simply doubling the avg viewership, a year of a big boost of viewers.




**TCL**


**Avg viewership:**
2019 summer split: **26 886** which is **+34.24%** compared to 2018 summer split


**Peak viewership:**
2019 summer split: **90 832** which is **+4.45%** compared to 2018 summer split


Big growth both in summer and spring of more than 30%!



**LJL (Japanese league**
**This data doesn’t include finals as they are yet to take place**


**Avg viewership:**
2019 summer split: **17 355** which is **+50.87** compared to summer 2018


**Peak viewership:** 
2019 summer split:**30 120** which is **+0.03%** compared to summer 2018


A fantastic 50% growth on summer not even including the finals day that will likely make these numbers even bigger.





**OPL**


**Avg viewership:**
2019 Split 2: **6 317** which is **+78.75%** compare to 2018 split 2


**Peak viewership:**
2019 split 2: **14 778** which is **-6.80%** compared to 2018 split 2


OPL might have the lowest viewership of the major league but they had the biggest growth of them all!






**SuperLiga Orange (Spanish regional league)**


**Avg viewership:**
2019 sumer split: **11 876** which is **+78.90%** compared to 2018 summer split


**Peak viewership:**
2019 summer split: **57 688** which is **+82.75%** compared to 2018 summer split


Once again big growth in both splits!





**LLA (latin american)**


**Avg viewership:**
2019 closing Split: **13 677** 


**Peak viewership:**
2019 closing Split: **48 120**


LLA is a result of a merge betwen some leagues so no point of comparation but CLS closing season on 2018 (I believe the most viewed region of the ones that merged) had an avg viewership of 6 664 so the avg viewership doubled.






On spring every single reagion but North america had a very significant growth in terms of avg viewers, on the summer the same thing happened but this time even North America had a small growth making the numbers positive to every region.",2019-09-14 17:38:14

986,Skiz Shedding some light on the NA LCS playoff games one at a time.,0,d44ve8,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/d44ve8/skiz_shedding_some_light_on_the_na_lcs_playoff/,0,1568494823.0,I'm starting with the C9 vs CLG Game 1 in the semifinals and working my way around each of the interesting series that took place in the NA LCS playoffs. I have a lot going on irl so I'll get around to them all eventually. Here's where you can find the video [https://youtu.be/fQnUaeMFnYs](https://youtu.be/fQnUaeMFnYs). I don't ever post in reddit like that so I'm not really sure about the rules I guess I'll go read them soon.,2019-09-14 17:00:23

Any tips on how to learn?,2019-09-14 16:59:50

989,The ability to use a Zhonyas active should be reserved for certain champions,0,d44paw,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/d44paw/the_ability_to_use_a_zhonyas_active_should_be/,8,1568493825.0,"The ability to get a stopwatch should be limited or removed. I wouldn't mind it being exclusively available through Runes, but every time I watch a pro game and see something like a Sejuani stopwatching feels awful. Seeing someone completely caught out, just hitting a 600 gold zhonyas and turning a fight doesn't feel like it should be a thing. That doesn't feel like ""skill"" to me. The ability to become invulnerable for 2.5 seconds should be something that's limited to very few people.",2019-09-14 16:43:45
990,Is there a stat site that compiles all time champion statistics?,1,d44opb,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/d44opb/is_there_a_stat_site_that_compiles_all_time/,1,1568493736.0,"It’s pretty traditional for the main stat websites to organize your champion stats and win rates by season, but I was wondering if there was one that could organize and sort for all-time?

I’m trying to come up with a new list of mains and wanted to check my success in the last few seasons as a whole.",2019-09-14 16:42:16
991,How does one earn or purchase prestige points?,1,d44nm4,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/d44nm4/how_does_one_earn_or_purchase_prestige_points/,7,1568493549.0,"I've never quite followed how to earn/purchase these point because I never thought I'd find myself in a situation where I wanted a prestige skin. But then they made one for Neeko, who is arguably my favorite champ in the game.

So I purchased star guardian Neeko and now how do I get the points to the the prestige edition? Does it have something to do with the battle passes or the token stashes or something? Forgive my ignorance but I never really learned how any of the loop see ""reward"" systems work.

Thanks in advance!",2019-09-14 16:39:09
0,How come Karthus is not nerfed yet?,0,d5qkzd,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/d5qkzd/how_come_karthus_is_not_nerfed_yet/,0,1568798924.0,"This is literally champion that EVERYONE are complaining about no matter the rank. You simply powerfarm till 6 and always get kills/assists. You have strong ganks but you don't need to as you will pressure enemy team with your R. Your death is simply 7 seconds Zonhya during which you can cast spells, not worth to kill you and your damage makes you priority in teamfights anyway. Like okay Riot, if you want some rank powergrinding with 0 effort champion then okay, you can already hit diamond without any sweat by simply spamming Karthus jungle but just for the notice - he is so unbalanced that this is unreal.   


And no, I did not lose the game against Karthus, on the contrary! My friend plays it all the time if we're in ""I want easy win mood"" but I came into the conclusion that playing that champion is simply unfair. Ofc people can always ban him but the game shouldn't be ""karthus not banned = lost"", ""I won game against karthus AMA"". I would LOVE to see Karthus on mid lane again. That would at least give ANY counterplay against him (ganking him as he is very  vulnerable to ganks).  


I wonder for how long Karthus paintrain will last.",2019-09-18 05:28:44

What is the consensus on this subject? Could it ever become an out of control issue? And should it even be stopped? Or is it an advantage that should be used?

I am interested to hear the people's thoughts on this.

Also, just as an extra thought, almost every player I see on stage at the moment is drinking caffeine to be more mentally aware, whether that's in the form of a coffee or Red Bull.",2019-09-18 05:32:16
